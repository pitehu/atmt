I feel very stron@@ g@@ ly about that .

Tom is boring , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a bi@@ o@@ di@@ versity crisis .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the floor b@@ ene@@ ath .
there is a pond in the middle of the park .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
she speaks too much .
no taxi stopped .
you must not stop on the hard shou@@ l@@ der to go to the toilet .
something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets upset easily .
this man is a leg@@ end .
enjoy your meal ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a sno@@ b .
I figured I could count on you .
we &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the price is reas@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ stri@@ es increas@@ in@@ g@@ ly became g@@ eared for ou@@ ter space .

it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at furniture we can &apos;t afford .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the empty box .
she made him rich .
he was standing at the top of the mountain .
she le@@ an@@ ed to@@ wards me .
this is what I wanted .
you remind me of myself when I was your age .
these pie@@ ces of furniture are not for sal@@ e .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a list yet ?
without o@@ x@@ yg@@ en , all animals would have dis@@ appear@@ ed long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my fault , not yours .
no one is am@@ used .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
while we were having tea , there was an earthquake .
either they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
what is in your hands ?
we need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the market .
it was one of the most re@@ war@@ ding experi@@ ences of my life .
he is responsible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ dering doing that .

I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my keys ?
that &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s absolu@@ te nonsense !
the teacher punished her students for using bad words .

I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the ca@@ b .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cousin .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .

some teachers have a great effect on their students .
we &apos;re old friends .
we avoid talking about poli@@ tics .
I am not available .
do you believe in Christ@@ i@@ an@@ ity ?
none of these cars are mine .

Tom was on TV yesterday .
painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely slipped my mind .
food is necessary for life .
that sounds good !
we char@@ tered a bus .

you &apos;ve o@@ m@@ itted the pre@@ position in this sentence .
enjoy yourself to the ful@@ lest .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bored . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom intended to do that .
the firm has its head office in O@@ sa@@ ka .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming pool .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him swee@@ p the floor .
I don &apos;t have those answ@@ ers .
my daughter likes to play with dol@@ ls .
have you ever been there ?
are you through with your work ?

I thought that you were going to wait for me .
can cats really see in the dark ?

I thought she was stupid .
I a@@ woke to find everything had been a dream .
she knows herself well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat rice every day ?
hardly had he entered the room , when she burst into tears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of he@@ igh@@ ts as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take advantage of the opportunity .
I opened a bottle of red wine .
you have a great imagination .
she volunteered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .
I adm@@ it I was surprised .
when will you return ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start or@@ dering people around .
what is the use of philosophy ?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my seat .
I had something plan@@ ned .
Tom has travel@@ ed around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the nu@@ n pra@@ yed and crossed herself .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
she advised him where he should stay .
new blan@@ kets were distribu@@ ted to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you safe .
it isn &apos;t expensive .
Ho@@ ly Tom !

I &apos;d suggest that you clean up a bit before your mother gets here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you add me ?
I suppose we have nothing to lose .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is involved in a cri@@ me .
if your answer is correct , it fol@@ lows that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ ey@@ moon in a foreign land .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they burned all the do@@ cu@@ ments .
you &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believed you .
the ha@@ ll was decor@@ ated with Japanese pain@@ tings .
if I were in your place , I would lend him a hand .
nobody suspe@@ cted anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hurry .
they ir@@ oned out their differ@@ ences .
these aren &apos;t my keys .
we are having lunch .
a growing child requires more food .
how long did they live in England ?
how is your daughter ?
it &apos;s lunch time .
see what happens when you give people advice ?
it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .

I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel .
I was completely de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .

I think so .
you look nervous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .

I rarely see him on the Internet .
what has he done ?
please tell me .
you have to be prepared .
it &apos;s not much of a surprise , is it ?
the cup broke when it fell off the table .
down came the rain in tor@@ ren@@ ts .
I do sympath@@ ize with you .
when are you going to ask her ?
water bo@@ ils at a temperature of 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es c@@ enti@@ gra@@ de .
that doesn &apos;t worry me at all .
I looked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe none of them .
the heroin isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m celebr@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I parked the car .
whatever you do , don &apos;t smile .
it would be better for both of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could solve the puzzle .
women are physic@@ ally wea@@ ker than men .
I feel like such an idiot .
what have you done today ?
I arrived on the night he left .
her feelings are easily hurt .
I know it was an accident .
there are many pi@@ ge@@ ons in the C@@ ity S@@ qu@@ are .

I don &apos;t know what to say to make you feel better .

I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m glad I learned English .
we can &apos;t do this again .
are you hurt ?
that &apos;s the reason she &apos;s late .
I was speaking to you .
he has over@@ stepped his auth@@ ority .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
push the button here .
sol@@ dering S@@ M@@ T comp@@ on@@ ents requires a bit more experience than sol@@ dering through @-@ hole comp@@ on@@ ents .
I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my favorite subject in high school .
it would be better if you work this afternoon .
if for some reason that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami slept in his tent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I expected it to be .
they appointed him as a director .
almost everything has been im@@ proved .
I really like this one .
we found one large foot@@ pr@@ int and a couple of different size smaller foot@@ prin@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were taken pri@@ s@@ oner .
what is the tallest mountain in Europe ?
Tom lost his glasses somewhere in the garden .
he has been to France .

I &apos;d prefer to die rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like math .
she advised him to talk about his life in the United States .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any doubts , do you ?
Tom burst out laughing .
I can not afford to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ handed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for patience .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ plac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s calm .
she was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same decision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large bedroom .
let the cat out .
I finally met her .
I &apos;ll go wherever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compla@@ ints about the way Tom be@@ ha@@ ves .
we &apos;re not invited .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to disp@@ lay only the lines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; inside .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t throw the ball near the windows .
the Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ net inside .
that &apos;s just what I needed .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want further information .
I could hardly endure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful but@@ ter@@ fly .
French was the language of diplo@@ mac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your hou@@ r@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a F@@ ren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respond .
as my father and my grandfather have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fruit .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an irre@@ gular con@@ ju@@ gation in all languages .
do you want me to repeat the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere building .
have you already eaten ?
it &apos;s really awesome .
he always takes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his lap to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true warrior .
Tom needs lots of courage and perseverance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
thank you for inv@@ iting me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is silent and wa@@ gs its tail .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m ki@@ dding .
the bicycle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some peanuts .
I use the Internet as a resour@@ ce for my re@@ search .
he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dra@@ wing took me five minutes , but I took sixty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your rules .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re wasting time .
what did you get hit with ?
cars are expensive .
they were not impressed .
to tell the truth , I drove my father &apos;s car without his permission .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we gotta have all the data in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive engagement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is twice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the date yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ itect , right ?
were you busy ?
I defe@@ ated the warrior .
you are not the only one responsible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to travel with only one suit@@ case .
you &apos;re wasting both of our time .
early expl@@ or@@ ers used the stars for na@@ vi@@ gation .
his salary is too low to support his family on .
this is a very time @-@ consu@@ ming task .
your phone is rin@@ ging again .
Tom wants to marry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a piece of pie .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
let &apos;s walk a little faster .
I know exactly where I am .
my mom bought me this to@@ y when I was eight years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a huge mistake .
breakfast is served .
this is illegal .
I &apos;m not in the mood to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye ?
we managed to swim across the river .
Mary wants to brea@@ st@@ feed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more slowly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom po@@ in@@ ted out my mistake .
the pat@@ rol@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll send you a postcard .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the law .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not gold .
one of the gu@@ ards is dead .
you owe it to yourself to do it .
parents must provi@@ de their children with proper food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t beat about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are supposed to obe@@ y the law .
whatever you do , don &apos;t push that button .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re wearing .
are you acc@@ using me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t drive now . you &apos;ve been drinking .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t resist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s OK .
follow your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contract is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and celebr@@ ate .
according to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have n@@ ine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to Spain on holiday .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
this broken vase cannot be repaired .
we must have faith in the president .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to les@@ s@@ en the impact of the er@@ ra@@ tic supp@@ lies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a duck .
we cannot rule out the possibility that ci@@ vil war will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answ@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w salad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I meas@@ ure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can ey@@ eball it if you want . &quot;
sign this .
whose book is this ?
he danced like a lea@@ f in the autumn wind .
you must be ca@@ u@@ tious .
she promised to meet him at the coffee shop .
he &apos;s very polite .
pickpockets may oper@@ ate in this area .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lock the door .
speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
we need to remember that .
we must talk her out of this foo@@ lish plan .
yes , as far as I know .
I was t@@ resp@@ as@@ sing .
it &apos;s cold outside .
please beat the eggs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ reali@@ stic to expect Tom to do that .
a whale is a mammal .
I wrote down his phone number on a s@@ cra@@ p of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curi@@ os@@ ity .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
insp@@ ired by her teachers , P@@ har@@ amp is going to start her so@@ lar car@@ eer tomorrow .
I lost the bet .
are there survivors ?
does he speak ? he sings , rather ! since I seas@@ oned it , we can no longer stop it .
Americans eat special foods on T@@ han@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
we &apos;ve had a lot of compla@@ ints about how you treat your clas@@ sm@@ ates .

you don &apos;t know who I am .
not everything is about you .
rooms are black .
you don &apos;t need to turn up your ther@@ mos@@ t@@ at when it &apos;s cold outside .
Tom is standing over there near the fi@@ re@@ place .
do you mind if I turn down the TV ?
I tried that .
Tom went to my room .
why are you busy today ?
when he ran into difficul@@ ties , he asked his parents for help .
where did you learn this ?
do you have a ticket ?
I go to the park .
you could hear a pin drop .
anybody can make a mistake .
she helped me out coun@@ t@@ less times .
let &apos;s wait and see how things go .
his wife opened the door for him .
it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
that made me very sad .
I don &apos;t have time to go to the movies .
I want to pay with a check .
there is little milk in the j@@ ar .

W@@ i@@ pe your tears .
it took me more than two hours to translate a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting harder for me to concentr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not crea@@ tive .
the books were so val@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the greatest care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fact , all great disco@@ ver@@ ers have been re@@ gar@@ ded as drea@@ mers .

I promise that you won &apos;t be disappointed .
can you drive manual ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I me@@ ssed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a cha@@ in smo@@ ker .
P@@ eas@@ ants often have a secon@@ d@@ ary acti@@ vity to au@@ g@@ ment their income .
our pas@@ sports were canc@@ elled .

I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ tail party .
Tom has agreed to help us .
I &apos;m super hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my fault !
if the situation doesn &apos;t improve , I &apos;ll be oblig@@ ed to take meas@@ ures .
I have an umbrella in my car .
whose shoes are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat beef .
do you know where he went ?
the bear is big .
I &apos;ll take your suit@@ case to your room , si@@ r .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door needs another coat of paint .
I told you so !
he always went fishing on the river when he was young .
he has three sons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to improve your Spanish , you shouldn &apos;t have come to Ch@@ ile .
I know you like to travel .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the moun@@ tains and to the sea .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he a@@ ven@@ ged the mur@@ der of his father .
my watch loses ten minutes a day .
he is completely be@@ so@@ t@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air condi@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was fal@@ sel@@ y accused .
he didn &apos;t know how to express himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a headache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s ahead of schedule .
Tom rarely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ ker .
when we look at other plac@@ es in the universe , it could very well be that pho@@ tos@@ y@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exce@@ ption .
it &apos;s true that it would be easier for students if there were only one single Spanish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
I won &apos;t run away like a coward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice seriously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the kids yet that we &apos;re getting divor@@ ced .
let me carry it for you .
I prefer to write in French .
he failed the entrance exam .
someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a shower now .

I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dictionary .
if I &apos;d only taken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the exam .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my pleas@@ ures is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any stars in the sky ?
Tom apologi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is growing th@@ ick@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .

he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .

we were concerned .
A@@ chi@@ e@@ ving a nice wel@@ d be@@ ad is not within everyone &apos;s reach !
it was not a complete victory .
we elected Tom captain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
funny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she handed me a postcard .
I just have to do something .
nobody insul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was favor@@ able .

did you know that men who regularly take the bir@@ th control p@@ ill don &apos;t get pregnant ?
we &apos;ve had no compla@@ ints .
do you miss it ?
don &apos;t worry , I have every ang@@ le co@@ vered .

the student missed class three times in a row .

I suppose you &apos;re already packed and ready to go .
I had bar@@ ely got into the house when the phone rang .
Tom wasn &apos;t in a good mood then .
I found the ear@@ ring that you lost .

you &apos;re the teacher .
how much more suff@@ ering can they endure ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for work .
can you help me write a love letter ?
I haven &apos;t done this since high school .
something is wrong with this cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ or .
the story cannot be true .
did you understand what I meant by that ?
please throw me the ball .
I do not like mathematics very much .
Americans spend most of their lives working , being produ@@ ctive .
prices rose higher and higher .
speak in a loud voice when you give your speech .
she took off her clothes .
the T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel@@ ler de@@ voted his attention to his dinner , and disp@@ la@@ yed the appe@@ tite of a tr@@ amp .
how did you come by this painting ?
how much did they give you for your old car ?
he married a pretty girl .
I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make noise . the baby is sleeping .
how do you deal with it ?
let &apos;s wait an hour .
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I wonder what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I brought you another blan@@ ket .
S@@ am is two years younger than Tom .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
you are in Boston .
that &apos;s not your problem anymore .
I know that you are busy .
you are a doctor .
will the train leave on time ?
I &apos;m willing to help you if you want me to .
I don &apos;t know how to descri@@ be it .
Mary always y@@ ells when she &apos;s angry .

when I entered the kitchen , she was making chicken cur@@ ry with rice .
I am through with my work .
who is the man sitting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents hardly ever punished me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don ship .
the off@@ icial we di@@ sch@@ ar@@ ged of his ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his legs are long .
Mary was lucky to find her keys .
it began to snow .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a present for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may choose whichever you want .
I never talked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this concert was awesome .
what is life without the radi@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ disp@@ u@@ table fact that Americans are , as Americans , the most self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous people in the world , and the most addi@@ cted to the belief that the other nations of the earth are in a con@@ sp@@ irac@@ y to under@@ val@@ ue them .
we &apos;re s@@ unk .
do not under@@ estim@@ ate my power .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ cked up .
I bet you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
unfortunately , they are very po@@ or@@ ly edu@@ cated people .
the writer does not always present life as it is .
language and cul@@ ture can &apos;t be separ@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .

if C@@ le@@ op@@ at@@ r@@ a &apos;s nose had been shorter , the history of the world would be different .
his room was small but clean , and the food was good .
his slee@@ ve touched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a sac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
Smith has spent years studying the effe@@ cts of sleep and sleep loss on memory and learning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of exercise .
the cat ruined my sofa .
we &apos;re less than hal@@ f@@ way to the top of the mountain . are you already tired ?
congratu@@ lations !
I &apos;m regularly feeling down in the du@@ mp@@ s .
they &apos;re all on vacation .
if you can , come with us .
I trust Tom &apos;s jud@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the manager .
a crowd was ga@@ ther@@ ing around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is .
it was your mistake .
it was very rude of you to say a thing like that .
these tex@@ ts were written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , not in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic .
you look familiar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a t@@ our of America , stopping in six ci@@ ties .

so ta@@ sty !
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
I probably should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the dish@@ cloth@@ s with the ser@@ vie@@ tt@@ es .
I thought he would be upset .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the shor@@ test @-@ lived profes@@ sions there is .
the milk is sour .
does anyone speak English ?
he appe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be impossible to get a completely error @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us due to the nature of this kind of col@@ lab@@ or@@ a@@ tive effor@@ t . Ho@@ we@@ ver , if we en@@ courage me@@ mb@@ ers to contri@@ bu@@ te sentences in their own languages rather than exper@@ im@@ ent in languages they are learning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ ize er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the worst thing you can do !
has he got any experience of f@@ ar@@ ming ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ruined everything .
because they &apos;re watching television .
we &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
write your address here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a wan@@ dering pe@@ dd@@ ler .
Tom walks slowly .
keep prac@@ ticing , Tom .
I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minute .
he already knows that .
all of a sudden , Tom and I were alone .
thanks to you , I spent all my money .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
if you are to realize your dream , you must work harder .
I hate the tie you &apos;re wearing .
I like this book .
mother no@@ ted that my feet were not clean .
I really loved you .
the girl is I@@ ri@@ sh .
please per@@ mit me to ask you some questions .
I was married .
he doesn &apos;t have his medi@@ cation .
each generation would have to re@@ disco@@ ver for itself the tru@@ ths of the past .
it goes without saying that hon@@ est@@ y is the key to success .
time to rise and shine .
he did it any@@ way .
the pay is terrible and the hours are long .
how old is the universe ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six months pregnant with our first son .
this is hard for me .
they can &apos;t do that .
I miss his kiss .
what are your reasons for practi@@ sing Chinese medicine in the U@@ K ?
the neighb@@ or asked us to turn the music down .
I tried to tell you .
I ski@@ pped out on my appointment with my boss .
he turned his mind to it .
he was nearly run over at a cros@@ sing .
every country has its own history .
Tom made me read this book .

I wanted to speak with you first .
Tom admitted he had acce@@ pted a bri@@ be .
you can help .
you must prepare yourself for the worst .
they think I &apos;m a mil@@ li@@ onaire .
we mistook him for an American .
we must accept our existence as far as possible .
I believed you .
he lied about his age .
there is something I must know .
the box had been damaged , but its con@@ t@@ ents were in@@ tact .
the slow@@ est one to make a promise is the most faithful one in keeping it .
this telephone is out of order .
I stre@@ t@@ ched out my legs .
you &apos;re very kind , Tom .
I did all the work .
make it as spic@@ y as you can .
not bad for a begin@@ ner .
Tom was looking at a picture of Mary .
they treated me badly .
please write down what I say .
he had never for@@ given A@@ d@@ รฉ@@ la@@ รฏ@@ de for not having those heavy brea@@ sts , those wide but@@ to@@ cks that are a cre@@ d@@ it to fa@@ mi@@ lies .
he was anx@@ ious to meet you .
we listened car@@ efully in order not to miss a single word .
Mar@@ i@@ e put on her most beautiful dress to go to the theater .
don &apos;t judge me too har@@ sh@@ ly .

one of you two is going to have to go there .
&quot; can I write K@@ ab@@ yle at Tatoeba ? &quot; &quot; what I say bel@@ ongs to the o@@ live tree . the words are no longer mine . &quot;
can you see anything at all there ?
he was all wrong .
give me some time to think .
the situation is very compli@@ cated .
you will soon get to like him .
it must be the post@@ man .
I took part in the spor@@ ting ev@@ ent .
I sympath@@ ize .
I just want a little more time .
the moment I held the baby in my arms , it began to cry .
there are no oranges on the table .
it depends on what you mean .
I heard that he &apos;d died .
forget it . it &apos;s not worth it .
just reading a computer manual is like prac@@ ticing swimming on dry land .
please understand my position .
is it difficult to learn G@@ ree@@ k ?
could you tell me how to ad@@ just the vo@@ lu@@ me ?
his house is by the river .
he &apos;s rich enough to buy two cars .
Tom didn &apos;t go to the hospital .
that &apos;s where I was born .
that is a boat .
she was fin@@ ed 10 dollars for that .
I don &apos;t see how that is any of your business .
le@@ mons are sour .
Tom may know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
you &apos;re too slow .
why was Tom killed ?
I always kept my promises .
Tom worked until 2 : 30 .
why are you insul@@ ting me ?
since it was so hot , we went swimming .
it &apos;s the best .

I don &apos;t want to go through another experience like that .
M@@ en@@ na@@ d knows .
he found it .
Sami received his in@@ her@@ it@@ ance from his father .
I like the way you treat me .
do we need an univer@@ sa@@ l language ?
this girl &apos;s a@@ unt works at our place .
my gra@@ de is above the average .
she agreed with him on what to do with the old car .
do you work here ?
this reci@@ pe is very easy .
it bel@@ ongs to my brother .
you have changed since I saw you last year .
is death the only way out ?
one can have an in@@ stant acc@@ ess to the des@@ ired information on the Internet .

I feel way more comfortable now .
she admitted to having heroin .
I didn &apos;t try to kill anybody .

one must wait for the resi@@ du@@ als to conver@@ ge before being able to use the si@@ mu@@ lation &apos;s results .
they &apos;re cooking now .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .

the kitchen is not a suit@@ able place for argu@@ ments . too many knives .
we came by to wish you luck .
I &apos;m yours .
they never talk but they qu@@ arre@@ l .
we &apos;re trapped !
I want to see them .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
one is never so happy as one thinks .
I have nothing to say about that .

I know what we can do .
I can &apos;t really remember .
no one warned us .

do you sometimes get p@@ is@@ sed off for no reason ?
put the lu@@ gg@@ age somewhere .
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;m not paid enough to give a d@@ am@@ n .
my friend helped me .
how do you respond to that ?
I &apos;m not crazy .
dinner &apos;s ready .
do you think Tom wants to eat now ?
I want you to help us .
I think you made the right choice .
what were you studying last night ?
I &apos;m disappointed and angry .
&quot; do you want to go to the ball with me ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sorry , but I can &apos;t . &quot;
we walked to my room .
we &apos;re too close .
we didn &apos;t learn anything .

I started with two traveling comp@@ an@@ ions .

good thing I learned English .
you have a watch .
can I touch your hair ?
just do it .
do you want this shirt ?
what condition is the building in ?
no matter how hard I try , I can &apos;t do it any better than she can .
she was horri@@ fied .
her French has gotten much better .
the door is locked .
you might want to take a look at this .
all you have to do is to concentr@@ ate .
would you be willing to send me a sa@@ mple free of charge ?
French isn &apos;t my native language .
we &apos;re all very good players .
it &apos;s as cold as ice .
I &apos;m sick of this .
I want everything to be perfect .
what were you waiting for ?
you can &apos;t att@@ end ? why not ?
for all our efforts , things have not turned out better .
Tom should pay what he owes .
are you about done ?
what time does your watch say it is now ?
you need to be more patient .
there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need for blood don@@ ors .

I am a hungry spider .
Mary slee@@ ps a lot .

he went to art school to study painting and s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
I can &apos;t tell you how much your support means to us .
I can now die a happy man .
you don &apos;t look very comfortable .
you shouldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
we &apos;ve been ab@@ and@@ oned .
I was a victi@@ m of a pick@@ pocket .
since there was no taxi , I had to walk home .
during my childhood , I often came here to ob@@ serve the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ d@@ ings and med@@ itate .
no , you don &apos;t know J@@ a@@ v@@ a . you know J@@ ava@@ S@@ C@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ T .
that &apos;s one of ours .
Tom sha@@ ved off his be@@ ard and d@@ yed his hair bl@@ on@@ de , hoping people wouldn &apos;t recognize him .
my hobby is to cook .
who do you think can help me ?
do you have an au@@ tomo@@ b@@ ile ?
in autumn , the moon is very beautiful .
you know what might happen , don &apos;t you ?
I owe what I am today to my parents .
I &apos;m coming to your rescu@@ e !
if I &apos;d known the truth , I &apos;d have told you .
she served me coffee .
English cannot be ma@@ stered over@@ night .
the beautiful is always strange .
I think I could handle that .
I had a good time , too .
my time has not yet come .
he &apos;s a go@@ al kee@@ per .
that &apos;s very big .
it &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
this is serious , Tom .
you &apos;re all alone .
I &apos;ll explain it all later .
you &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
he wants to reach a wi@@ der au@@ di@@ ence .
I always walk .
I owe my success to my friends .
I think we &apos;re out of danger .

B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a reg@@ al@@ ed us with ama@@ zing stories about her trip to T@@ i@@ bet .
where do you get off telling me that ?
can you pay me in adv@@ ance ?
&quot; are you serious ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolutely serious . &quot;
I fired the gun .
Oh you poor little thing .
he jump@@ ed into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an older woman .
every mo@@ ve@@ ment is painful .
she liked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did warn you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until Monday .
I meant to call her , but I forgot to .
you don &apos;t look very strong .
I completely appro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer f@@ est@@ i@@ val .
they caught Tom .
she was absent from school because she was sick .
everybody wants per@@ man@@ ent pe@@ ace .
her sor@@ row was only app@@ ar@@ ent .
Jane looks very pale .
Tom committed suicide in pri@@ son .
Tom is a member of the S@@ W@@ A@@ T team .
they had to change their schedule because the train arrived late .
&quot; quiet , &quot; he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed .
you seem to know everything .
in two mo@@ ves , K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v will check the challen@@ ger .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese cul@@ ture and history .
she looked troub@@ led by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me nervous .
do you mind much ?
it is clou@@ dy now .
the show star@@ ts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very understanding .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hiding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .

the ele@@ v@@ ator seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ os@@ ing whether I should listen to reason or my feelings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that sofa re@@ up@@ hol@@ stered .
the old woman is too weak to get out of bed .
even if it costs 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 y@@ en , I must buy the dictionary .
he is so old that he cannot walk quickly .
please wait a moment .
prepare yourself .
they admitted they were scared .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjoy spending time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ an@@ der up .
it &apos;s a fruit .
I &apos;m lying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of eating at the school ca@@ feteria .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a message ?
how lonely and hel@@ ple@@ ss she must feel left all by herself !
as the first pack emer@@ ges , the spe@@ ct@@ at@@ ors take pictures with their camer@@ as and mo@@ b@@ ile phones .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I needed to eat less candy .
I didn &apos;t s@@ cream .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can explain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy houses .
it &apos;s in the garage .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a solution .
he &apos;s gone into hiding .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ an@@ cial advis@@ er .
I am an arti@@ st .
you should buy her new toys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ pping bal@@ ls .
she is nothing to him .
Ju@@ lian wears round glasses like John L@@ en@@ n@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fired from your last job ?
I like funny guys .
I usually get up at eight .
there is a big park near my school .
this desk has lost one of its legs .
we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it rains .
is it possible to deter@@ mine the dia@@ me@@ ter from the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ f@@ erence ?
do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
and on sunny days all the pi@@ ge@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling OK ?
Sami re@@ se@@ mb@@ les the suspect .
what is your number ?
we believe in a better world .

we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark outside .
I can &apos;t read A@@ rab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they ha@@ ted Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the theory that one should learn L@@ at@@ in in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being serious !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .

we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my appe@@ tite away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve eaten in an Ital@@ ian pizz@@ er@@ ia .
no one can deny the fact .
above all things , we must not be selfish .
I have difficulty concentr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ wel@@ ling on the pleas@@ ures of the past .
I &apos;ll stay involved .
this happened pri@@ or to recei@@ ving your letter .
Tom likes techno@@ logy .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is blue .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the government is re@@ desig@@ ning the cur@@ ren@@ cy to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting .
ac@@ id rain is not a natural phenomenon .
we should pre@@ serve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tryside .
I can get us there more quickly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ mp@@ et .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I owe you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
carry these books back to the book@@ shelf .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?

she has international re@@ no@@ wn as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom slip and fall .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with numb@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I built this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .
he &apos;s broke .
she is far from honest .
there are good gr@@ ounds for the view that Paris was the scene of f@@ requ@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ volution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four seas@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I &apos;m incre@@ di@@ bly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver medal .
everyone looks worried .
I object to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a sandwich &quot; B@@ ut@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this lab@@ or@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these ha@@ ts .
we &apos;ll decide later .
last winter , I went ski@@ ing in Can@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this sofa can seat three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please prepare for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel une@@ as@@ y without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or single ? do you live alone or are you in a rela@@ tion@@ ship ?
the sky is clear . not a cl@@ oud in sight .
I &apos;m not stopping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing sitting down is not all that bad .
check these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it corre@@ ctly .
Tom is as tall as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this lake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
an en@@ orm@@ ous space station ori@@ b@@ iting around J@@ up@@ it@@ er over@@ looked the rain@@ bo@@ w stri@@ pes of the gas giant .
the injured were removed from the scene .
the train is arri@@ ving !
I &apos;ll pay you .

I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cu@@ re for what a@@ ils you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the result .
do not be shy . your pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hum@@ id and lu@@ ke@@ warm .
of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day .
she is as flat as a pan@@ cake .
this article is more interesting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you hit your children ?
beauty pleas@@ es the eyes , kindness en@@ ch@@ ants the soul .
our plan went wrong from the beginning .
I don &apos;t enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need tea ?
a child should not get more spending money than is necessary .
the pizza is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his sudden appearance .
no one could deny this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional baseball game .
Tom &apos;s innocent .
everyone gathered together for the picture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is jealous .
please ref@@ er to the touri@@ st information office .

be@@ sides the rain , we experi@@ enced heavy win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but wealthy town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the seven sac@@ ra@@ ments .
he asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ac@@ hing you .
does Tom still rely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ fic@@ ation .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his finger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to rescu@@ e him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
this job gives me the hu@@ mp .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ e@@ cy came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
have a nice weekend !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to repeat a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; stories . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all geniuses are engineers , but all engineers are geniuses . the set of all engineers is th@@ us an , unfortunately proper , sub@@ set of all geniuses .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom ignored our advice .
we will be done in at most an hour .
I see her laughing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her clea@@ v@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ related .
it &apos;s mis@@ lead@@ ing .
the only one who can solve this problem is you .
what a beautiful rain@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a nervous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at keeping secrets ?
try hard to hold it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t sound entirely convinced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a quar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ oud ?
she was on the scene of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fucking sense .
his eyes were smiling behind his glasses .
miss Sa@@ to is the president &apos;s new secre@@ tary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something art ?
please make five copies of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your pills ?
it sno@@ wed yesterday .
don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at least thirty minutes ago .
it &apos;s not supposed to happen .
he hit me twice .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never gotten a spee@@ ding ticket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish le@@ aped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more precious than time .
are there any b@@ ags in this shop ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very rude .
he &apos;s painting his house .
Tom looks like a foreig@@ ner .
I had two copies of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go downtown .
tell me what you did on your holi@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mistakes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes slow .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ ford U@@ ni@@ versity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will snow tomorrow .
you &apos;re too na@@ ive .
his be@@ ard was thick and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re ashamed of our father &apos;s poverty .
that &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for months .
what year were you born ?
please drop in when you happen to be in the neighbor@@ hood .
he is ea@@ ger to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
we &apos;re both wit@@ ne@@ sses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a b@@ ath .
you don &apos;t have permission to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the patient was di@@ sch@@ ar@@ ged from hospital .
do you think Tom can return ?
I have no money to buy the dictionary .
Sami refused to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I returned to Japan .
she visited the old man in the hospital every day but Sunday .
she came to Japan for the pur@@ p@@ ose of studying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ cted and im@@ pregn@@ ated by wol@@ ves who lan@@ ded their flying sa@@ u@@ c@@ er in my back@@ y@@ ard .
why did God create the universe ?
pass me the sugar , please .
that was cool .
is this one of your crea@@ tions ?
there was a heavy rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I men@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having doubts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wore a red bl@@ ouse .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s soft .
the town was full of acti@@ vity .
leave him alone .
I had no in@@ tention of doing so .
the Earth and Su@@ n are just tiny do@@ ts among the b@@ illi@@ ons of stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I suggest we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you recognize the man in this photo ?
I want to join your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a ca@@ feteria in the university .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of yourselves .
be kind to little animals .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ lowing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ ashed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the desire for le@@ is@@ ure is stronger than the other ur@@ ges , le@@ is@@ ure win@@ s .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the mountain . are you really already exhausted ?
few students can read L@@ at@@ in .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I finally found a use for this old thing .
I want to warm myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bother you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admire your determination .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can persuade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay single .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer vacation .
I made a pot ro@@ ast .
is she still single ?
she is not as beautiful as her older sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ e@@ su@@ s .
don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en eggs .
you mis@@ understood me .
I don &apos;t know either of his brothers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will hold talks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to protect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the wedding be held ? &quot;
only a miracle may get him out of it .
can I see your driver &apos;s license ?
this should solve all your problems .
the man reading a newspaper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any luck ?
I &apos;m a stranger here .
someone threw a rock at him .
he kissed me on the fore@@ head .
Mar@@ ia didn &apos;t suspect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with whom she had been cor@@ respon@@ ding for months over the Internet and whom she secre@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was actually a super @-@ intelligent squirre@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ dom bit@@ es unless it is attacked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined that he was innocent .
he is a man who is fond of ceremony .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before shoo@@ ting your big mouth off .
he is very afraid of dogs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is or@@ din@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look pale as a gh@@ ost .
catch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the kids ?
philosophy is often re@@ gar@@ ded as difficult .
the radio doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consider the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time .
the space bar is an al@@ ph@@ anu@@ mer@@ ical ke@@ y@@ board &apos;s key .
that job is impossible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black box .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
these two lines cut across each other at right angles .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dre@@ sses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s smart , handsome and polite .
don &apos;t put all your eggs in one bas@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in New York , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apologize for the way I acted last night .
may you be touched by H@@ is N@@ oo@@ dly Ap@@ pen@@ d@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fa@@ in@@ ted .
how much is the express ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I realize what he meant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lots of phones .
keep your eye on the ball .
I burned my hand with an iron .
that &apos;s impossible .
we love our mother almost without kno@@ wing it , without feeling it , as it is as natural as to live .
it scared me .
when I &apos;m hot , a glass of cool water really ref@@ re@@ sh@@ es me .
can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is ?
the ste@@ w smells delicious .
Tom talks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ ink , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
you still haven &apos;t finished paying for your washing machine ?
there is a rock in my sho@@ e .
this dog will protect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve master .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
it &apos;s un@@ for@@ gi@@ vable to date such a broken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side during this painful or@@ deal .
look at this mess .
he is anything but a reli@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is solu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to memor@@ ize the for@@ mul@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you expect to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is fluent in German , but with a s@@ light American acc@@ ent .
she always expe@@ cts me to help her .
go and speak to my colle@@ ag@@ ue .
I do want to see you .
he was sla@@ in in b@@ attle .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to blame you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a hammer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I reached the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a miracle .
what &apos;s your fin@@ al destination ?
once upon a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a book@@ kee@@ per compu@@ tes all the company &apos;s income and expen@@ ses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
he has a video .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wondering .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can recommend this restaurant .
the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ e was es@@ cor@@ ted off the pre@@ mis@@ es .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
Kate has been given an opportunity to play a major role in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the straight path .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was disappointed at my answer .
we re@@ no@@ v@@ ated a house .
who taught you French ?
you &apos;re the pretti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ruined it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teach me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you mean .
unfortunately , I already have plans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated by water .
I have plenty of friends .
excuse me , but I think this is my seat .
this is an op@@ tical ill@@ us@@ ion .
let &apos;s move !
it was a gam@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she travel@@ s abroad .
why does Tom have a gun ?
you touched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
excuse me si@@ r , could you tell me where the place of the cinema lo@@ cated ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ignore him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a drunk lying on the road .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is becoming more and more compli@@ cated .
every day you should at least listen to a short song , read a good poem , look at a beautiful picture , and , if possible , say several intelligent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living somewhere else .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was famous for its hanging gar@@ den@@ s .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the enemy dropped many bo@@ mb@@ s on the fac@@ tory .
I &apos;m here all the time .
did you understand any of that ?
I have no words .
don &apos;t forget to answer his letter .
don &apos;t forget to bring kitchen u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils such as knives and cooking po@@ ts .
no , that &apos;s not true . Tom didn &apos;t change his name . it &apos;s just a rum@@ our .
you dead .
it was a close game .
whose is the dictionary on the table ?
just behave yourselves .
after lunch we have two more cl@@ asses .
she &apos;s bright and arti@@ cu@@ late .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional baseball game .
we got along fam@@ ously .
the cap@@ ital of Brazil is B@@ ras@@ i@@ li@@ a .
where did you go ?
he decided to have the oper@@ ation .
N@@ ao@@ mi has just finished her work .
he married my cousin .
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to can@@ ce@@ l the trip .
she is very shy and feels ill at e@@ ase at parties .
I feel b@@ les@@ sed .
in the late 20@@ th cen@@ tury , Y@@ ug@@ os@@ la@@ vi@@ a was considered a ro@@ gue state by the United States .
that &apos;s what I &apos;d want .
hand me the hammer .
kids do stupid things .
you &apos;re very intelligent .
it &apos;s all ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able .
she touched my shou@@ l@@ der .
she went there yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot of traffic today .
your face is always dirty .
it happened here .
I &apos;ll fix a drink .
I &apos;d be disappointed if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had known that , we would &apos;ve come sooner .
I can &apos;t be man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated .
what do you think of his sugg@@ est@@ ion ?
open those doors !
didn &apos;t you read the manual ?
he wants a play@@ mate .
she spends all of her money on clothes .
Dan &apos;s message was insul@@ ting .
we wouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
this hat is mine .
the first photos of the Earth taken from ou@@ ter space cap@@ tur@@ ed the imagination of an entire generation .
pickpockets target touri@@ sts .
I know you did this .
that looks like the work of a virus .
fuck your mom , bit@@ ch .
he who is not satisfied with a little , is satisfied with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a different t@@ ack ?
I have been wan@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just knock on the door ?
in France , where the site was f@@ ounded , Tatoeba has become a cul@@ tur@@ al and so@@ cial phenomenon .
I speak K@@ ur@@ man@@ j@@ i .
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark .
I slept all day .
it &apos;s a mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent view , isn &apos;t it ?
a small lu@@ mp of sugar , please .
what does this have to do with me ?
she has good sense .
he works in a bank .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
do you remember what you were watching ?
keep your hands up .
how fast !
I left it un@@ locked .
go sit in the car .
when I grow up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ vable person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ick@@ name ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s R@@ ick . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere in others &apos; af@@ fa@@ irs .
you can fool all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fool all the people all the time .
the pressure is building .
close the fucking door !
he is interested in music .
reading books is my hobby .
I like my stea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lucky .
Tom speaks French very flu@@ ently .
unfortunately , that hasn &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll cost around thirty dollars .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s guitar is new .
Tom was lucky .
the little kids were very curi@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ it@@ u@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these shoes are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other condition ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I adm@@ it that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the players on this team are all gi@@ ants .
this one is the worst .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secret weapon .
you won &apos;t be disappointed .
it was so still that you would have heard a pin drop .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very glad to hear the news .
Dan spent the night having sex with Linda .
don &apos;t use your real name .
this book is really small !
Ko@@ al@@ as are cute .
I &apos;m never happ@@ ier than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book worth reading is worth reading twice .
was anybody hurt ?
it &apos;s double pleasure to decei@@ ve the decei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak Russian , too .
get the fuck out !
he enjoys good health .
all the sweet talk was just a r@@ use to get her into bed .
Mi@@ h@@ o plays piano better than N@@ ori@@ ko .
it means that he likes you .
I knew it would happen sooner or later .

they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to spell that word .
is this all yours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his rac@@ ist i@@ dea@@ s to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold weather , but Tom does .

I can &apos;t forgive him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody help him .
Mary sings best of all of the girls in class .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !
do you want help with that ?
I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
I &apos;m talking nonsense .
you don &apos;t seem to realize how serious this is .
Tom won &apos;t bother you anymore .
why did you come here today ?
that &apos;s more re@@ cent than you think it is .
how can I up@@ lo@@ ad a photo to your website ?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me .

I usually take a shower after I play tennis , but today I couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been a big help .
everybody is sleeping .
I haven &apos;t seen him lately .
three years ago today , Tom and I got married .
I read somewhere that animals can sense an earthquake before it h@@ its .
J@@ im@@ my in@@ si@@ sted that I take him to the zoo .
the prin@@ ce succeeded to the thr@@ one .

Tom wants to say yes , but he can &apos;t .
you must listen .
he was be@@ at@@ en too easily .
they slept in the same bed .

come on , answer quickly .
she usually gets up early .
we are Australi@@ an .

my uncle is in his for@@ ties .
nobody can hear you .

no one knows where he lives .
I like to fish in the river .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .

I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to wear glasses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
he is a true col@@ os@@ su@@ s .
I may know someone who can help you .

I paid two hundred dollars in taxes .
congratu@@ lations , and thanks for everything !

I just don &apos;t like it .
Ju@@ d@@ ging from his appearance , he must be a rich man .
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened .

I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his success .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to sit on the ben@@ ch over there next to the street la@@ mp .

let &apos;s go to P@@ au@@ l &apos;s D@@ in@@ er .
you ought to be quiet in a library .
Tom fell asleep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only sli@@ gh@@ tly smaller than the Earth and Mar@@ s is bi@@ gger than half of Earth .
do you find that washing machine easy to use ?
she committed a cri@@ me .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ wards them .

don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ val on price .
let me buy you a drink .

I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ osco@@ w ?
he &apos;s hell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very comfortable .
the crimin@@ al is sure to do time for rob@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is honest .
her belief in God is very firm .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language refle@@ cts daily experience .
Tom began to shi@@ ver viol@@ ently .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he failed .
he should get to your house in an hour .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to practi@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less it is light out .
I didn &apos;t move a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these fos@@ s@@ ils are the &apos; smoking gun &apos; just before the emer@@ g@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gency .
how far do we have to go ?
children grow very quickly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that mathematics , being after all a product of human thought independent of experience , is so adm@@ ir@@ ably ad@@ ap@@ ted to the obje@@ cts of reality ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .

C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her skin was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is smart .
let us sing a song .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ e@@ min@@ ine lo@@ gi@@ c is not always logical .
when we started out , our band could only find small clu@@ bs in small ci@@ ties that would hi@@ re us .
you should respect the rules your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ rying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll lend it to you .
I may need to move on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
quit talking , will you ?
they set out for New York .
I despise them .
my cat slept next to me .
forgive me .
the floor is co@@ vered with a thick car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ arm not far from Boston .
an animal can be much more dangerous when w@@ ounded .
can you drive a stick shi@@ ft ?
I go to the theat@@ re .
Dan parked the ren@@ tal car near the police station .
where do you want to go for our first lesson ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ dered why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of attr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ kers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ ounds to his ambi@@ tion .
P@@ ine@@ apple is rich in c@@ it@@ ric ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ broken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be alive .
you can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the lake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
giving up smoking is the eas@@ iest thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it thousands of times .
the dog is thirsty .
I heard that a gay pri@@ est had been pro@@ mot@@ ed to the rank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you mean , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fight .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a stranger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mistaken assu@@ mp@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she loved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I ple@@ ad@@ ed not guilty .
we can &apos;t postpone the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invited .
long live the ger@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the piano .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of mean@@ ness , but rather out of absent @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to strangers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction for beef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such nonsense .
I want you to be quiet .
C@@ ot@@ ton ab@@ sor@@ bs water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on Sunday .
you guys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to cook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both alter@@ na@@ tives are possible .
maybe I should also add sentences without translations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ proving the pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to bet on that ?
we made sac@@ rific@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve ch@@ osen her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kissed .
stop t@@ wi@@ sting my arm !
if he sen@@ ds me any letters , I just tear them up and throw them away .
I was warned .
sooner or later , Tom will likely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ dge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher expla@@ ining ?
we &apos;d like separ@@ ate che@@ cks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cros@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re warm enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ est@@ ors are . our p@@ ap@@ ers got lost during the F@@ l@@ ood .
sit down and shut up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the supermarket .
D@@ ro@@ ple@@ ts are falling on my laptop computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be intelligent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a member .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ deed , d@@ war@@ f tos@@ sing is an O@@ ly@@ m@@ pic sport !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promises .
I just want to be perfect .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to environ@@ mental changes .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America .
I don &apos;t have much interest in cooking .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ mber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fight with me ?
his kindness touched my heart .
he studies bi@@ ology very hard .
my uncle is rich .
to be perfect she l@@ acked just one defe@@ ct .
I hear him falling .
you don &apos;t have to be a victi@@ m .
which way is the beach ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more rice , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish !
Sami lived very close to the lo@@ cation where Layla &apos;s body was found .

he painted a dog .
where did you hide the food ?
I get ch@@ apped li@@ ps every winter .
they decei@@ ved us .
my feet are cold .
Mary acce@@ pted everything without compla@@ ining .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our escape was nothing short of a miracle .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I survi@@ ved .
this glass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to choose .
my dog has cancer .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the test .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they stood on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite skin care product ?
you can borrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in absolutely total ag@@ ree@@ ment .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody needs to know this .
fall is late this year .
they &apos;re on good terms with their neighbors .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always studies for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a rule .
who are you clos@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re worse than Tom .
do the Ger@@ mans have any other concer@@ ns in life apart from consu@@ mer@@ ism ?
you should not respect a man because he is rich .
the c@@ hair crea@@ ked as he sat down .
he expres@@ sed his belief in her hon@@ est@@ y .
only they themselves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was crying for her mother .
they ruined it .
they want pe@@ ace .
are we being char@@ ged with something ?
I really hate da@@ ir@@ y products .
I was right on the spot when it happened .
be punctual .
I am f@@ our@@ teen years old .
you look so pale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ var@@ k is a medi@@ um @-@ si@@ zed animal .
the school rules requi@@ re students to wear school uni@@ forms .

I have two eyes .
I &apos;ve removed the comm@@ a .
do you have an ex@@ tr@@ a key ?
his bad leg prevented him from winning the race .
you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admire her efforts .
we can &apos;t get close to the enemy .
there are a lot of stars larger than our own Su@@ n .
they aren &apos;t du@@ mber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to normal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good cook .
are you watching the presi@@ dential deb@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who spread these rum@@ ours ?
that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ aga@@ w@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you considered me a close friend .
things will only get worse .
the girl is drinking tea .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your fault .
she met him on the beach .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had gotten no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ pping off during the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eaten yet ?

don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it sno@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
your question is not rele@@ v@@ ant to the subject .
she came to see me .
this c@@ hair is too small .
how much time do you actually spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the doors of per@@ ce@@ ption were clean@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ finite .
beer is my fuel .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the por@@ ter for car@@ rying your lu@@ gg@@ age .

take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I ordered .
this is such a waste of time .
Tom is always playing video games .
I have been to the store before .
stop sen@@ ding me flowers .
please un@@ dress from the wa@@ ist up .
that &apos;s a stupid question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ ster your product ?
Dan had to decide whom to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ healthy .
there is a television in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to clean the house .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ ash@@ cards due .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had gathered outside the cour@@ th@@ ouse .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the ca@@ p off this bottle .
I recogni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
Al@@ though Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ ten@@ ted .
I was bored .
if I were healthy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thirsty .
have fun with that .
there is something tro@@ pic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which forms a sin@@ gular contr@@ ast to her cool and une@@ mo@@ tional brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would listen to me .
I can &apos;t prove it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ vel I can borrow ?
you have changed since I saw you last year .
e@@ eny , me@@ eny , min@@ y , mo@@ e , catch a tiger by his to@@ e , if he hol@@ l@@ ers let him go , e@@ eny , me@@ eny , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to catch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stupid ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the sofa .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a duck on her shirt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear con@@ science when it &apos;s not used .
are you vege@@ tar@@ ian ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the workers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother depends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I parked my car .
I want to sort this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s strong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ lowing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher conf@@ is@@ cated a student &apos;s phone because he was tex@@ ting in class .
Jim hasn &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ hi@@ stor@@ ic men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should hang out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a sp@@ l@@ ash .
I don &apos;t mind len@@ ding you the money provi@@ ded you pay it back within a month .
Ah ... ok@@ ay , I was young , but what a stupid mistake !
in fact , I should thank you for this .
I was arrested on the spot .
I &apos;m studying art at school .
that never was an issue .
you should really lay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your health .
the medicine had no effect .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a series of tu@@ b@@ es .
Tom is here somewhere .
Tom stood very close to Mary .
he remained silent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thinks it is .
will they elect him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it rained , I stayed home .
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I wake up at 7 o &apos;clock .
they have a plan .
Tom did a good job .
Tom never said he wanted to go with us .
do you want some sugar in your coffee ?
are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
we &apos;re under att@@ ack !
it &apos;s very late .
the whole village knows the man well .
are you up for it ?
bite the bul@@ let .
I went to bed at twel@@ ve last night .
the effect was immedi@@ ate .
Mary has a new lover .
what color is Mary &apos;s scar@@ f ?
may I eat another piece of cake ?
you never get a second chance to make a first impres@@ sion .
he &apos;s all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to cats .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
Dan is now wanted by the police .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was raining heavily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the line was busy .
I have a coat , but I don &apos;t have a hat .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
you are washing dishes .
this won &apos;t solve anything .
sometimes T@@ on@@ y visited his family .
arti@@ ficial intellig@@ ence can now colle@@ ct information from so@@ cial medi@@ a and the inter@@ net to help desig@@ ners understand what the public likes .
I love to travel .
Tom has a bright car@@ eer as a medi@@ cal doctor .
C@@ row@@ ds filled the streets car@@ rying ban@@ ners .
Oh ! mar@@ vel@@ ous !
I learned it from you .
Jim seems to know the art of making friends with girls .
tell me exactly where he lives .
chicken po@@ x is a common sic@@ k@@ ness in children .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly how long it will take .
H@@ ence , lo@@ ath@@ ed mel@@ an@@ cho@@ ly .
I was bored because I had seen the movie before .
I believe that story .
Tom &apos;s grandmother looks healthy .
they &apos;re all in there .
many years ago flying used to be gla@@ mor@@ ous . now it &apos;s just a pain in the ne@@ ck !
I admire your perseverance and determination .
he gave her a pe@@ ck on the ch@@ ee@@ k .
our guests are in a hurry .
he went to bed .
which one should I use ?
Tom introduced Mary to his mother .
in Europe , people reg@@ ard punctu@@ ality as a matter of course .
get a room already !
most of these are mine .
Tom &apos;s dog has four legs .
many young people are out of work in that country .
why don &apos;t I have a boyfriend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
we had to make a decision .
B@@ r@@ illi@@ ant !
I think this is be@@ side the point , right now .
this is a dog .
I need to go shopping .
language is the symbol of a na@@ tion &apos;s existence .
I have finished my homework .
I figured that you &apos;d be impressed .
it smells delicious .
it is two o &apos;clock in the morning .
I miss you .
I am a cat . I don &apos;t have a name yet .
you can &apos;t have your cake and eat it .
just as I thought something was ru@@ st@@ ling there , a cat le@@ aped out of the bus@@ h .
this place is packed !
I really like that guy .
they speak French in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c .
a black and white dog bit me .

I &apos;m going to join a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so special .
Tom is respe@@ cted by everybody .
this book is much more useful than that one .
A@@ chi@@ e@@ ving a nice wel@@ d be@@ ad is not within everyone &apos;s reach !
someone spi@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still alive , he &apos;d be very old by now .
would you trust them ?
I wish I could live in a house that nice .

I &apos;m what the world cal@@ ls an idiot .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .

where exactly do you live ?
I went to the post office .
I &apos;d like to welcome you all abo@@ ard .
I will let you know in adv@@ ance .
he is miles away .
what a wonderful morning ! I feel on top of the world .
I can &apos;t help myself .
I was there last night .
they who dream by day are co@@ gni@@ z@@ ant of many things which escape those who dream only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the weather is clou@@ dy .
how could you not say something ?
in all li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood , we shall be away for a few days .
what vegetables do you usually grow ?
if I were rich , I &apos;d buy a car .
he broke down when he heard the bad news .
I don &apos;t know which button to push .
she is next to them .
he doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I &apos;m well aw@@ are of the risk .
I love c@@ ab@@ b@@ age !
stop corre@@ cting me .
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee .
thousands of people wanted to know the answer .
there are some things that are difficult to translate .
are they taking care of you ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a new car .
we want natural @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding translations , not word @-@ for @-@ word direct translations .
this is how you get results .
it kept me from reading .
I was sho@@ cked at the sad news .
I think this is mine .
how come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
girls like to show off their fine clothes .
this is Tom &apos;s third trip to Australia .
Mary ir@@ oned her skirt .
she saw him at the station .
I &apos;m playing with my friends .
I played soccer yesterday .
I can &apos;t go out .
I swear to God , if one more person here says &quot; giant ro@@ bo@@ t , &quot; you &apos;re all as good as dead .
I think that Tom is still sleeping .
I don &apos;t think I can keep that promise .
you used to smoke , didn &apos;t you ?
strange to say , the teacher didn &apos;t s@@ cold me .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
they started all at once .
he went abo@@ ard the plane .
everybody is against me .
his be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or did not cor@@ respond with his words .

he plays the guitar .
mine is better than yours .
I &apos;m awake .
I am not understanding what the auth@@ or is trying to say .
I guess I didn &apos;t want to dis@@ appo@@ int you .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .

Tom read the letter .
fear is es@@ senti@@ al for survi@@ val .
please give me a sp@@ are blan@@ ket .
why do I have to sing with Tom ?
Tom and Mary visited S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ vi@@ a .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ation doesn &apos;t cost anything , but it takes time .
the news spread little by little .
we are Australi@@ an .
give me a kiss .
he was ignor@@ ant of the fact .
I get mad at his arrog@@ ance .
give me a hand with this .
Tom arrived late at the station .
he was sick , but he went to school .

Tom sho@@ ws his camera to his brother .
actually , I &apos;m kind of busy .
do you own a computer ?
Su@@ ck@@ ers !
even though he has turned twenty , he &apos;s still too timid to ch@@ at with girls .

G@@ il@@ ded re@@ ins do not make for a better horse .
how heavy you are !
the size of the universe is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able .
how do you read this k@@ an@@ j@@ i ?
our task has been easy so far , but it will be difficult from now on .
she will make a good wife .
I could have prevented this .
traveling was much more difficult in those days .
this is what I bought in Spain .
I &apos;m very interested in the evolution of the din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s .

it is too dark for me to read .
why didn &apos;t you read the magazine ?

I can &apos;t understand why you are so cri@@ tical of him .
my brain is fri@@ ed .

she allowed him to go alone .
I think Tom killed himself .
my skirt is too long .
do you speak German ?
watch the front .
I have only just arrived .
I have another engagement .
how does Tom plan to help ?
