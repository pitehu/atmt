I &apos;d appreciate your help .

I don &apos;t sup@@ p@@ ose there &apos;s much chance of that happ@@ ening .
H@@ ey , don &apos;t do that !
I understand why .
life is not an ex@@ act sci@@ ence , it is an art .
my mother al@@ lowed me to go ab@@ road .
he se@@ ar@@ ched his po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts for the key .
I still live at my d@@ ad &apos;s place .
D@@ u@@ bl@@ in is in I@@ re@@ land .
please put the light out when you leave the room .

where can I get a ca@@ b ?
we had a rea@@ l good time .
it was kind of fun .
he felt it was his du@@ ty to go .

what are some foo@@ ds you usu@@ ally eat with your children ?
the bi@@ gg@@ est concer@@ n is cost .
a little na@@ p and , just like that , I &apos;m as f@@ re@@ sh as a da@@ is@@ y .
we &apos;ll dea@@ l with it in the morning .
we have people every@@ where .
you have to pay the pri@@ ce .
we wal@@ ked more qu@@ ick@@ ly than usu@@ al .
we live .
I hel@@ ped Tom .
don &apos;t do anything stu@@ p@@ id .
in order to make this cake you need ba@@ king po@@ w@@ der and un@@ sal@@ ted bu@@ tter .
A@@ n@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating a cold win@@ ter , we bought a bi@@ g@@ ger sto@@ ve .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand .
me@@ mor@@ i@@ ze it well .
co@@ ws are s@@ ac@@ red to many people in In@@ di@@ a .
the ro@@ of is really in need of re@@ pa@@ ir .
correct er@@ r@@ ors .
they &apos;re brother and sister .
I just wanted to say thank you .
he has very little inter@@ est in his children .
I like K@@ e@@ v@@ in N@@ as@@ h .
how do you for@@ m the pl@@ ur@@ al of n@@ oun@@ s ?
the work is m@@ os@@ tly done .
Tom tal@@ ked too much and let the secre@@ t sli@@ p .
what are you afraid of ?
Tom killed a man .
I really like you .
your trou@@ b@@ les are just beg@@ in@@ ning .
can you trans@@ late a love letter ?
I do not know why I said that .
I will per@@ for@@ m my du@@ ties with pleas@@ ure .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
I &apos;ll tell my d@@ ad !
he got very angry , for she ref@@ used to fol@@ low his advice .
we are not rich .
ato@@ mi@@ c en@@ er@@ gy can be used for pe@@ ac@@ eful ends .
I will go if you go .
stop y@@ el@@ ling .
there are only 1@@ 0 minutes left until the end of the les@@ son .
Sami has a ri@@ de .
she doesn &apos;t want him to pic@@ k the flow@@ ers .
I want you to remember this mo@@ ment .
there used to be a store right here .
two small bot@@ t@@ les , please .
I knew you had a bo@@ y@@ friend !
there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need for the lo@@ cal go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to help the ho@@ me@@ less .
you &apos;ve been had .
there is nothing left to eat .
I can &apos;t st@@ and being tre@@ ated like a child .

the company is@@ su@@ ed a pre@@ ss re@@ le@@ ase .
it &apos;s ab@@ sur@@ d of you to do that .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
I wanted to speak to you about this .
have you anything to de@@ cl@@ are ?
he has no bicycle .
are you saying I have no sense of hu@@ m@@ or ?
today is not so cold .
women have beau@@ ty , but do books not also have beau@@ ty ?
where was your father ?
the inter@@ n is la@@ zy .
I have a little something for you .
I like to inv@@ ent us@@ eful things .
students study in school .
anyone who is not sho@@ cked by qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory has not underst@@ ood it .
we would have hel@@ ped them .
my TV is bro@@ ken .
we have enough .
I got into a f@@ ight .
it is a sup@@ er idea .
don &apos;t tell him I told you .
I had no idea you were inv@@ ol@@ ved .
for the past few years , te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers who im@@ it@@ ate over@@ we@@ ight am@@ er@@ i@@ can r@@ app@@ ers have been wal@@ king like in@@ ver@@ ted pen@@ du@@ lu@@ ms , s@@ win@@ g@@ ing from left to right , which is the only way for@@ ward if you we@@ i@@ gh over two hun@@ dr@@ ed and si@@ x@@ ty p@@ oun@@ ds , but completely ine@@ ffe@@ ctive if you are a s@@ cra@@ w@@ ny te@@ en@@ ag@@ er we@@ igh@@ ing half of that , since most of the en@@ er@@ gy is wa@@ sted on side ste@@ ps , not to men@@ tion the sh@@ e@@ er ab@@ sur@@ d@@ ity of that s@@ win@@ g@@ ing ga@@ it .
Sami &apos;s plan@@ e hasn &apos;t even ta@@ ken off .
you should have spo@@ ken more poli@@ tely .
if it &apos;s that hot , how about you take off all your clothes ?
I don &apos;t have a ti@@ cket .
she is my mother @-@ in @-@ la@@ w .
Tom wasn &apos;t w@@ ear@@ ing sho@@ es .

so , what else is going on ?
you will find the restaurant on your right .

two th@@ ous@@ and people f@@ it into this ha@@ ll .
he has this large room to himself .
don &apos;t you ever come here again !
I got into trouble with the poli@@ ce by dri@@ ving too fast .
a sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c the@@ ory is a h@@ y@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that has been pro@@ ved by te@@ sting .
they were all here .
I think that you have been b@@ ra@@ in@@ wa@@ sh@@ ed .
hand me my mu@@ g .
buy four big p@@ ot@@ ato@@ es for me .
I s@@ wear to God this is true .
I thought I had a good chance .
he told me that his father &apos;s a teacher .
he wasn &apos;t a good mus@@ ic@@ ian .
in the cen@@ ter of the univer@@ s@@ ity ca@@ mp@@ us stan@@ ds the st@@ at@@ u@@ e of the f@@ oun@@ der .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I know who he is .

I wonder why I didn &apos;t think of that .
we expe@@ ct heav@@ y resi@@ st@@ ance .
I &apos;ll try to pay this b@@ ill tomorrow .
Tom left everything to Mary in his will .
I &apos;m not as s@@ mar@@ t as you .
we need a pas@@ s@@ word to use this computer .
d@@ ur@@ ing the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar &quot; A@@ n@@ ne of G@@ re@@ en G@@ ab@@ les &quot; was dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted by the P@@ o@@ lish go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to tr@@ oo@@ ps in the t@@ ren@@ ch@@ es to re@@ mind them of what they were fi@@ gh@@ ting for .
pri@@ ces are high .
would you be friends with me ?
I can &apos;t go out because I have a lot of ho@@ me@@ work .
if you get bit by a r@@ ab@@ id dog , you &apos;ll need a te@@ t@@ an@@ us shot .
I &apos;m not ready for this .
I agree with what you say to some ex@@ t@@ ent .
he put the key in the lo@@ ck .
this time , you &apos;ve g@@ one too far .
they were not im@@ pres@@ sed .
I &apos;ve never v@@ ot@@ ed .
let me hand@@ le it .
how much ren@@ t do you pay for the ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment ?
I can har@@ dly brea@@ the .

O@@ K , very good .
you should stay in the hospital for tre@@ at@@ ment .
could you please tell me again who your father is ?
do you have a b@@ ac@@ k@@ up plan ?
everyone started laugh@@ ing .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
I even wrote a letter to her .
what &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
we have way too much work to do .
he is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly att@@ ac@@ hed to her .
he is not such a na@@ st@@ y fel@@ low as you think .
I &apos;m happy you li@@ ked it .
we have come a long way .
this is my fav@@ our@@ ite sub@@ ject .
how many languages are spo@@ ken wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ?
in a man@@ ner of speaking , yes .

I as@@ sure you this is about much more than money .
did you forget to do your ho@@ me@@ work ?
I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bi@@ ke .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
he is ha@@ ted by all .
I don &apos;t b@@ ite .
this will only take a secon@@ d .
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday .

he went into re@@ ha@@ b .
we must think about these pl@@ ans in ter@@ ms of what they would cost .
he &apos;s feeling much better .
Tom sin@@ gs in a ch@@ ur@@ ch cho@@ ir .
he felt u@@ ne@@ as@@ y in his father &apos;s pres@@ ence .

the stor@@ m did great da@@ ma@@ ge to her pro@@ per@@ ty .

it &apos;s very cold , this win@@ ter !
this is bad .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I am not against your opinion .
he sel@@ d@@ om or@@ d@@ ers anything new .
I quite co@@ tt@@ on@@ ed on to that man .
he came run@@ ning .
he is not himself today .
it &apos;s not going to be easy to fin@@ ish this job on time .

thank you for your ef@@ for@@ ts .
I need to see you in my office .
the c@@ os@@ ts are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
don &apos;t me@@ ss with me !
I feel very str@@ on@@ g@@ ly about that .
she o@@ w@@ es me money .
can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
this little girl lives in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I feel like someone just wal@@ ked over my g@@ ra@@ ve .
give me ch@@ ap@@ ter and ver@@ se .
can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
our gar@@ d@@ en pro@@ du@@ ced an ab@@ un@@ dance of c@@ ab@@ b@@ ages last year .
why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t st@@ and this hot weather .
give us the de@@ ta@@ ils .
she w@@ it@@ ne@@ s@@ sed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was tr@@ app@@ ed in a v@@ ic@@ ious c@@ ir@@ cle .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s secre@@ ts .
you should be more careful the next time .
Tom makes a lot of mista@@ kes .
it will be ready soon .
there &apos;s a com@@ par@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ ely large c@@ ine@@ m@@ a comple@@ x in@@ side the m@@ all .

most of them ur@@ g@@ ed him to take the job .
Sami came to give L@@ ay@@ la her gi@@ ft .
nothing was f@@ un@@ ny .
I never lo@@ ved you .
let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is bor@@ ing , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a bi@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity cri@@ s@@ is .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the flo@@ or b@@ en@@ e@@ ath .
there is a p@@ on@@ d in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the par@@ k .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
she spea@@ ks too much .
no ta@@ x@@ i st@@ op@@ ped .
you must not stop on the hard sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to go to the to@@ i@@ let .
something is wrong with the en@@ g@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom ge@@ ts up@@ set easily .
this man is a le@@ g@@ end .
enjo@@ y your me@@ al ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a s@@ no@@ b .
I fi@@ g@@ ured I could coun@@ t on you .
we &apos;d like another bot@@ t@@ le of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner ser@@ ved ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the pri@@ ce is reas@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ es in@@ cre@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly became g@@ ear@@ ed for ou@@ ter sp@@ ace .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
just pre@@ t@@ end you don &apos;t know me .
the name of my country is written without any ar@@ ti@@ cle .
the in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ed world is used to using water prof@@ lig@@ ately .
thank you for your de@@ ta@@ iled ex@@ plan@@ ation .
you &apos;re my her@@ o , Sami .
my le@@ gs are wea@@ k .
she doesn &apos;t know the ti@@ t@@ le of the book you &apos;re talking about .
let &apos;s talk sho@@ p for a while .

run hot water into the b@@ ath .
she tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .

the ra@@ di@@ o is a bit l@@ ou@@ d .
Mary is a yo@@ d@@ el@@ er .
he kept on laugh@@ ing at me .
I could tell you about be@@ e@@ kee@@ ping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bor@@ e you .
don &apos;t all speak at once .
it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure we can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the e@@ mp@@ ty bo@@ x .
she made him rich .
he was stan@@ ding at the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain .
she le@@ an@@ ed to@@ war@@ ds me .
this is what I wanted .
you re@@ mind me of myself when I was your age .
these pi@@ e@@ ces of f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure are not for sal@@ e .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am lear@@ ning German .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a li@@ st yet ?
without o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , all an@@ im@@ als would have dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my fa@@ ul@@ t , not yours .
no one is am@@ used .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
while we were having te@@ a , there was an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke .
e@@ ither they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
what is in your hands ?
we need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the mar@@ ket .
it was one of the most re@@ war@@ ding experi@@ en@@ ces of my life .
he is respon@@ sible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing doing that .
I can think of se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons .
you might get hurt .
you &apos;re the only one who can help .
when was the last time you tal@@ ked to Tom ?
do you really think Tom is happy ?
you &apos;ve been in@@ fe@@ cted .
there were six sh@@ ee@@ p in the fi@@ el@@ d .
are you thinking about getting a job ?
I &apos;m still not sure .
if you fe@@ ed your dog pro@@ per@@ ly , you can in@@ cre@@ ase his li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
the st@@ re@@ et in fr@@ on@@ t of my house is pretty n@@ ar@@ row .
when are we going to leave ?

Tom had a little accident .

she &apos;s two years you@@ ng@@ er than him .
our teacher often over@@ looked his name on the li@@ st .
Tom still o@@ w@@ es me a lot of money .
get the h@@ ell out my way !
be careful !

I &apos;d pref@@ er not to eat that .

the pain has les@@ sen@@ ed a little .
I wish I could ex@@ pl@@ ain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my ke@@ ys ?
that &apos;s terri@@ ble advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te n@@ on@@ sense !
the teacher pun@@ ished her students for using bad words .
how can you acc@@ use me of such a thing ? I would never l@@ ay a hand on my child .
Tom is thir@@ st@@ y .
he has a S@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n acc@@ ent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is the@@ irs .
in times of cri@@ s@@ is one should never ide@@ al@@ ise the past .
you can &apos;t s@@ it there .
I like to swim in the af@@ ternoon .
I left my u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la in the ca@@ b .
I didn &apos;t even know you spo@@ ke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
no one has ever seen God .

we &apos;re old friends .

I am con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that he is in@@ no@@ cent .

is this wine from A@@ r@@ gen@@ t@@ in@@ a ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
there &apos;s no w@@ ind today .
there were no f@@ en@@ ces on the great pla@@ ins .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I think it would have been a better sh@@ oo@@ t with a 1@@ 0@@ m@@ m l@@ ens .
gen@@ i@@ us is only one re@@ mo@@ ve from in@@ s@@ an@@ ity .
I &apos;m going to show you the pho@@ to .
get rich !

I had never seen such a sh@@ in@@ y sta@@ r .
I want your name and b@@ ad@@ ge number .

he is too dr@@ unk to dri@@ ve home .
experience is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
pain@@ ting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
food is necess@@ ary for life .
that s@@ oun@@ ds good !
we char@@ ter@@ ed a bus .
ask me again some other time .
I don &apos;t want to up@@ set you .

enjo@@ y yourself to the fu@@ l@@ le@@ st .
Tom told me that he ha@@ dn &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o is a very expen@@ sive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bor@@ ed . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom in@@ ten@@ ded to do that .
the fir@@ m has its head office in O@@ sa@@ k@@ a .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming p@@ ool .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him s@@ wee@@ p the flo@@ or .
I don &apos;t have those ans@@ w@@ ers .
my daughter likes to play with do@@ l@@ ls .
have you ever been there ?
are you through with your work ?
you can &apos;t just leave your car par@@ ked in fr@@ on@@ t of the fire h@@ y@@ dr@@ ant .
I thought that you were going to wait for me .

I have a red home .
the teacher can see you .
nobody knows exactly how many r@@ ac@@ es make up the popu@@ la@@ tion of the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
the tre@@ es will soon be b@@ are .
I thought she was stu@@ p@@ id .
I a@@ wo@@ ke to find everything had been a drea@@ m .
she knows her@@ self well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat ri@@ ce every day ?
har@@ dly had he en@@ ter@@ ed the room , when she bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of he@@ igh@@ ts as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity .
I opened a bot@@ t@@ le of red wine .
you have a great i@@ mag@@ in@@ ation .
she v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really s@@ mar@@ t , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .
I ad@@ m@@ it I was surprised .
when will you re@@ turn ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start or@@ der@@ ing people around .
what is the use of ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y ?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my se@@ at .
I had something plan@@ ned .
Tom has tra@@ vel@@ ed around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the nu@@ n p@@ ra@@ yed and cr@@ os@@ sed her@@ self .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
she advis@@ ed him where he should stay .
new bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts were dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you safe .

you didn &apos;t let me answer .
G@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ ings , strang@@ er .
have you seen him before ?
the t@@ ree fell over in the t@@ y@@ pho@@ on .

this ti@@ cket is v@@ al@@ id for three days .

I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that you cle@@ an up a bit before your mother ge@@ ts here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you ad@@ d me ?
I sup@@ p@@ ose we have nothing to lose .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is inv@@ ol@@ ved in a cri@@ me .
if your answer is correct , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ on in a fore@@ ig@@ n land .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they bur@@ ned all the do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents .
you &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one belie@@ ved you .
the ha@@ ll was de@@ cor@@ ated with Japanese pain@@ t@@ ings .
if I were in your place , I would l@@ end him a hand .
nobody s@@ us@@ pe@@ cted anything .

I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at least w@@ il@@ ling to consi@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of other al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can fin@@ ally see the light at the end of the tun@@ ne@@ l .
I was completely de@@ v@@ a@@ st@@ ated .
he turned his th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts to@@ ward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he nee@@ ded more money .
Tom knows that he can w@@ in .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never re@@ ac@@ hed Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
I me@@ an to go tomorrow if the weather is fine .
may comes after A@@ pri@@ l .

there &apos;s a great restaurant around the cor@@ ner .
children f@@ illed the room .
why wouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
it &apos;s ra@@ ining cats and do@@ gs .
it &apos;s an exc@@ use .
I think so .
you look ner@@ v@@ ous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .
hurry up , girls .

I was on a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
he was my mat@@ h teacher .
you &apos;re cra@@ f@@ ty .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between a vir@@ us and a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a .

the boy was se@@ ar@@ ching for the lost key .
sugar dis@@ sol@@ ves in water .
it felt pretty good .
do you have a table on the pati@@ o ?
you &apos;ll find this les@@ son easy .
believe me . I &apos;ll be a new man .
if only I could already speak German f@@ lu@@ en@@ tly !
I want you to have a job that you love .
are Tom and Mary sure ?
I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .

did you have a pleas@@ ant trip ?
Tom never gi@@ ves anything to anybody .
H@@ ele@@ n K@@ el@@ ler was bl@@ ind , dea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b .
she didn &apos;t exactly agree with me .
I am won@@ der@@ ing if I could be of any ser@@ v@@ ice to you .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I like all of the s@@ on@@ gs Tom sin@@ gs .
D@@ ef@@ en@@ est@@ r@@ ate your clock to see how time f@@ lies .
Tom has a black cat .
any@@ way , if you want to know more about my country , I &apos;ll s@@ end you a letter when I get home .

I thought there was a pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that Tom was going to break the con@@ tr@@ act .
we might need to help Tom .
he ag@@ re@@ ed to give us an inter@@ vi@@ ew .
I don &apos;t know why I thought it would be different this time .

I know that you &apos;re s@@ mar@@ t .
I often go to the se@@ a .
what is her sho@@ e si@@ ze ?
I want to buy a shirt for my little brother .

there are a lot of t@@ att@@ oo@@ s on his body .
in the early days people comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ated by smo@@ ke si@@ g@@ n@@ als .
I have lo@@ ts of money .

I looked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
the her@@ o@@ in isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m ce@@ le@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
whatever you do , don &apos;t sm@@ ile .
it would be better for both of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
women are ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally wea@@ k@@ er than men .
I feel like such an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
what have you done today ?
I arrived on the night he left .

would you like a little help ?
I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m glad I learned English .
we can &apos;t do this again .
are you hurt ?

I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my favorite sub@@ ject in high school .
it would be better if you work this af@@ ternoon .
if for some reas@@ on that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami sle@@ pt in his t@@ ent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expen@@ sive as I expe@@ cted it to be .
they appoin@@ ted him as a di@@ re@@ ctor .
almost everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one large foo@@ t@@ pr@@ int and a cou@@ ple of different si@@ ze sm@@ al@@ ler foo@@ t@@ pr@@ in@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were ta@@ ken pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
what is the tal@@ le@@ st m@@ oun@@ tain in E@@ uro@@ pe ?
Tom lost his gl@@ asses some@@ where in the gar@@ d@@ en .
he has been to France .
you can take wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever road you like .
S@@ ally re@@ called the days when her grand@@ m@@ a was str@@ ong and heal@@ thy .
why don &apos;t you ask Mr W@@ h@@ ite ?
try to be more pun@@ c@@ tu@@ al from now on .
when I run , I get s@@ we@@ at@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
br@@ ing an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d pref@@ er to di@@ e rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she advis@@ ed him to talk about his life in the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any dou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bur@@ st out laugh@@ ing .
I can not af@@ for@@ d to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ han@@ ded .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for pati@@ ence .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ pl@@ ac@@ e@@ ment for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was h@@ it by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same de@@ c@@ is@@ ion I &apos;m making if he were in my sho@@ es .
I have a large be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ ha@@ ves .
we &apos;re not inv@@ ited .
you need to f@@ il@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to di@@ sp@@ l@@ ay only the l@@ in@@ es with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; in@@ side .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball near the windo@@ ws .
the Ear@@ th is like a ball with a large mag@@ ne@@ t in@@ side .
that &apos;s just what I nee@@ ded .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want f@@ ur@@ ther infor@@ mation .
I could har@@ dly en@@ du@@ re the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of di@@ p@@ lo@@ m@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your hou@@ r@@ ly pay ?
how could I li@@ e to you ?
he was a F@@ ren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grand@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of ki@@ ds in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fr@@ u@@ it .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ lar con@@ ju@@ ga@@ tion in all languages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere buil@@ ding .
have you already eat@@ en ?
it &apos;s really a@@ we@@ some .
he always ta@@ kes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true war@@ ri@@ or .
Tom nee@@ ds lo@@ ts of cour@@ age and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance because he has to pay at@@ tention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fortun@@ e .
thank you for inv@@ iting me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is s@@ il@@ ent and wa@@ gs its ta@@ il .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the se@@ par@@ a@@ ti@@ sts think that I &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding .
the bicycle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t as a res@@ our@@ ce for my re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch .
he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re wa@@ sting time .
what did you get h@@ it with ?
car@@ s are expen@@ sive .
they were not im@@ pres@@ sed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mis@@ sion .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ at@@ a in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expen@@ sive en@@ g@@ ag@@ e@@ ment ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is tw@@ ice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the d@@ ate yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my sho@@ es on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the war@@ ri@@ or .
you are not the only one respon@@ sible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to tra@@ vel with only one su@@ it@@ c@@ ase .
you &apos;re wa@@ sting both of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the star@@ s for na@@ vi@@ ga@@ tion .
his sal@@ ary is too low to sup@@ port his family on .
this is a very time @-@ con@@ su@@ m@@ ing t@@ ask .
your phone is r@@ in@@ g@@ ing again .
Tom wants to mar@@ ry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a pi@@ e@@ ce of pi@@ e .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a v@@ ill@@ age .
let &apos;s walk a little fa@@ ster .
I know exactly where I am .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was e@@ ight years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a hu@@ ge mistake .
breakfast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the m@@ ood to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying g@@ oo@@ d@@ b@@ ye ?
we man@@ ag@@ ed to swim ac@@ r@@ oss the ri@@ ver .
Mary wants to brea@@ st@@ fe@@ ed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more s@@ low@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom po@@ in@@ ted out my mistake .
the p@@ at@@ ro@@ l@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll s@@ end you a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the la@@ w .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not go@@ ld .
one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds is dea@@ d .
you o@@ we it to yourself to do it .
parents must pro@@ vi@@ de their children with pro@@ p@@ er food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are sup@@ posed to o@@ be@@ y the la@@ w .
whatever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that bu@@ tt@@ on .
I love the out@@ f@@ it you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing .
are you acc@@ using me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t dri@@ ve now . you &apos;ve been drin@@ king .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s O@@ K .
fol@@ low your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in Americ@@ a , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the con@@ tr@@ act is in the ba@@ g , so let &apos;s go out and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate .
ac@@ cor@@ ding to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have n@@ ine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to S@@ pain on ho@@ li@@ day .
Tom didn &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther he should do that or not .
this bro@@ ken v@@ ase cannot be re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed .
we must have fa@@ ith in the pre@@ si@@ dent .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to les@@ s@@ en the im@@ p@@ act of the er@@ ra@@ tic sup@@ p@@ lies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot ru@@ le out the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that ci@@ vi@@ l wa@@ r will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl ans@@ w@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I me@@ as@@ ure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can e@@ y@@ e@@ ball it if you want . &quot;
si@@ g@@ n this .

he &apos;s very poli@@ te .
pic@@ k@@ po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts may op@@ er@@ ate in this ar@@ e@@ a .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lo@@ ck the door .

we must talk her out of this foo@@ lish plan .

I tried that .
Tom went to my room .

I like the m@@ el@@ o@@ dy of this s@@ ong .

H@@ ar@@ b@@ in is very cold .
I caught a cold two days ago .
I &apos;m here not because of that .

did we miss anything ?
I couldn &apos;t do this without your help .
Tom is a nat@@ ur@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te .

Mary took the coo@@ ki@@ es out of the o@@ ven .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a ce@@ le@@ br@@ ity .
life is a my@@ st@@ er@@ y to be lived , not a problem to be sol@@ ved .

I forgot that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s best friend .
the dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy between the stor@@ ies of the two par@@ ties inv@@ ol@@ ved in the accident was so great that the au@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ ties had a hard time deci@@ ding which side was telling the truth .
in c@@ ase of rain , the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic meeting will be called off .
there is a cat .
be careful !
I love your son .
where are your car ke@@ ys ?
I think of you as a friend .
you have no need to be as@@ ha@@ med .
A@@ le@@ j@@ an@@ dr@@ a wrote to her p@@ en p@@ al in I@@ tal@@ y .
his ni@@ e@@ ce is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive and mat@@ ure for her age .
you do like living dang@@ er@@ ously .
sp@@ ring has re@@ turned . the Ear@@ th is like a child that knows po@@ e@@ ms .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ pe your t@@ ears .
it took me more than two hours to trans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not c@@ rea@@ tive .
the books were so v@@ al@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the gre@@ at@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong t@@ ree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of f@@ act , all great dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ers have been re@@ gar@@ ded as drea@@ m@@ ers .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promise that you won &apos;t be dis@@ appoin@@ ted .
can you dri@@ ve man@@ u@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I me@@ s@@ sed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a c@@ ha@@ in smo@@ k@@ er .
P@@ eas@@ an@@ ts often have a secon@@ d@@ ary ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity to au@@ g@@ ment their in@@ come .
our pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts were can@@ c@@ el@@ led .
medi@@ c@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ b@@ es it per@@ fe@@ ct@@ ly .
he works for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ key ?
why are you so c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or &apos;s dog is always bar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il party .
Tom has ag@@ re@@ ed to help us .
I &apos;m sup@@ er hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my fa@@ ul@@ t !
if the sit@@ uation doesn &apos;t im@@ pro@@ ve , I &apos;ll be ob@@ lig@@ ed to take me@@ as@@ u@@ res .
I have an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la in my car .
whose sho@@ es are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ e@@ f .
do you know where he went ?
the be@@ ar is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ c@@ ase to your room , si@@ r .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door nee@@ ds another coat of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went f@@ is@@ hing on the ri@@ ver when he was young .
he has three s@@ ons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ pro@@ ve your S@@ pan@@ ish , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have come to Ch@@ ile .
I know you like to tra@@ vel .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins and to the se@@ a .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he a@@ ven@@ g@@ ed the m@@ ur@@ der of his father .
my watch l@@ os@@ es ten minutes a day .
he is completely be@@ so@@ t@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot out@@ side that I want to spend all day in my a@@ ir con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was fal@@ sel@@ y acc@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pre@@ ss himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a hea@@ d@@ ac@@ he , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of sch@@ e@@ du@@ le .
Tom r@@ ar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ k@@ er .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the univer@@ se , it could very well be that pho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ i@@ er for students if there were only one sing@@ le S@@ pan@@ ish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the c@@ ase .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice ser@@ i@@ ously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday af@@ ternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the ki@@ ds yet that we &apos;re getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
let me car@@ ry it for you .
I pref@@ er to write in French .

I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a sho@@ wer now .

they can &apos;t do that .

I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ri@@ s@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
if I &apos;d only ta@@ ken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my pleas@@ u@@ res is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any star@@ s in the sk@@ y ?
Tom ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is g@@ row@@ ing th@@ ick@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
I &apos;m a lucky man .
Ear@@ ning our cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence and resp@@ ect is this fir@@ m &apos;s ob@@ je@@ ctive .
what will the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s think ?
you can &apos;t pro@@ ve a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ lies students with t@@ ex@@ t@@ books .
his d@@ el@@ ay of coming here on time is du@@ e to a tra@@ ff@@ ic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ e@@ gy .
Japan has a lot of tra@@ de with C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .

they are my friends .

he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .
he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were concer@@ ned .
A@@ c@@ hi@@ e@@ ving a nice w@@ el@@ d be@@ ad is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
it was not a comple@@ te v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory .
we ele@@ cted Tom cap@@ tain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
f@@ un@@ ny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she han@@ ded me a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I just have to do something .
nobody in@@ sul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was favor@@ able .
how many col@@ ou@@ rs are there ?
the language of fri@@ en@@ d@@ shi@@ p is not words but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I sp@@ ent a week with a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian family from G@@ a@@ z@@ a .
we &apos;re working to fi@@ x this bu@@ g .
let me con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ late you on your en@@ g@@ ag@@ e@@ ment .

at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ dance .
I want you to speak fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly .

I &apos;m on the inter@@ st@@ ate .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I fi@@ g@@ ured I might find you here .
Tom r@@ us@@ hed past me .

Tom is b@@ iting his na@@ ils .
how many of you are there now ?
I &apos;m s@@ mar@@ ter than you .
you &apos;re very nice .
I couldn &apos;t en@@ ter because the door was clos@@ ed .
the new tun@@ ne@@ l will l@@ in@@ k B@@ r@@ it@@ ain and France .
in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of going to school , he stayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really nee@@ ded .
I must br@@ ush up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan eat@@ s lunch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happ@@ ening .
Tom ru@@ m@@ mag@@ ed through the d@@ ra@@ wer , looking for a pen@@ ci@@ l .
do you need a ri@@ de home later ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father sp@@ ends a lot of time on his ho@@ b@@ by .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the pian@@ o ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your resi@@ st@@ ance .
M@@ on@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the weather today is wor@@ se than yesterday .
I plan to have lunch with him .
she is wa@@ ter@@ ing the flow@@ ers .
I think Tom eat@@ s too much me@@ at .
what di@@ re@@ ction are you going ?
I wish there were a French trans@@ la@@ tion of this book .
down came the rain in t@@ or@@ ren@@ ts .
she tried to com@@ for@@ t him , but he kept cr@@ ying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most wa@@ sted day of all is that on which we have not laugh@@ ed .
the way tou@@ ri@@ sts dress off@@ ends lo@@ cal st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of pro@@ pri@@ e@@ ty .
we can &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s a mis@@ underst@@ an@@ ding .
they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gu@@ e .
that lies out@@ side my ar@@ e@@ a of study .

here we took the bo@@ at for A@@ l@@ as@@ k@@ a .

I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
I have always felt that you always knew that Sami was your son .
we all have arrived .
I &apos;m on c@@ ru@@ t@@ ch@@ es for the next month .
I cannot stop the b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
he is always trying to do the im@@ possible .

the pri@@ ce of go@@ ld f@@ lu@@ c@@ tu@@ ates da@@ ily .
he is nothing but a po@@ et .
that can happen .
I &apos;ve decided to do the same thing .

how are you doing ? I haven &apos;t seen you in ages !
I boo@@ k@@ mar@@ ked this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .

tell me again where you live .
is that correct ?
she decided to mar@@ ry him .
she &apos;s lear@@ ning to swim .
I can &apos;t come and see you every day .
I &apos;ll close the door .
the women play ten@@ n@@ is .
which came first , the ch@@ ic@@ ken or the e@@ g@@ g ?
she pas@@ sed away yesterday af@@ ternoon .
I &apos;m going to take care of it for you .
now go have fun .
he married my cou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m really f@@ ed up with this h@@ eat .
Tom went to sleep three hours ago .
she was talking all the time .
there are se@@ ven days in a week .
what &apos;s that t@@ all buil@@ ding ?
are those your daugh@@ ters ?
I don &apos;t want to miss my train .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
we don &apos;t know what they want to use it for .
en@@ g@@ ine@@ ers try to take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of nat@@ ure rather than try to understand it .
do you work here ?
I saw land in the dist@@ ance .
that &apos;s a good guess .
the pri@@ s@@ on@@ er es@@ cap@@ ed under co@@ ver of night .
could you , please , l@@ end me your car tomorrow ?
they &apos;re right behind you .
we pre@@ sen@@ ted a watch to him .
I want to live in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I think Tom is cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous .
he hi@@ d@@ es his head in the s@@ and , like an os@@ tri@@ ch .
I don &apos;t think I have the experience necess@@ ary for that job .
she got a pres@@ ent from her bo@@ y@@ friend .
can you turn off the light ?
Mr W@@ h@@ ite made a few comm@@ ents on my sp@@ ee@@ ch .
he is nu@@ mb@@ ered am@@ ong the gre@@ at@@ est sci@@ enti@@ sts in the world .
could you try to be a little less sel@@ fish for a change ?
you won &apos;t be shot .
he has money .
we had lunch ear@@ li@@ er than usu@@ al and went out at tw@@ el@@ ve thir@@ ty .
they were pla@@ in@@ ly dre@@ s@@ sed .
it &apos;s yours if you want it .
I think it &apos;s dang@@ er@@ ous to c@@ li@@ m@@ b that m@@ oun@@ tain alone .
are you having dinner ?
why don &apos;t you believe them ?
b@@ en@@ ef@@ its of cour@@ se should ex@@ ce@@ ed the c@@ os@@ ts .
they were att@@ ac@@ ked .
I pro@@ t@@ est !
is anybody in there ?
the de@@ f@@ en@@ d@@ ant is being acc@@ used of a li@@ t@@ any of cri@@ min@@ al and ci@@ vi@@ l off@@ en@@ ses .
I thought Tom had ag@@ re@@ ed to do the job .
what should I eat ?
it &apos;s in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
he &apos;s not going to visit you tomorrow .
he may not be able to come .
the doctor se@@ i@@ zed the pati@@ ent &apos;s hand and said : &quot; so how do we feel today ? &quot;
where are you from ?
you &apos;ve never seen a gen@@ u@@ ine di@@ a@@ mon@@ d .
she came into the room .
she fol@@ lowed me into the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en and pic@@ ked up a k@@ ni@@ fe .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
he is pleas@@ ed with his work .
it beg@@ an to rain before I got home .
there are more B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts in Ger@@ many today than people who know how to make a good cho@@ co@@ late cake .
I didn &apos;t res@@ ist the pres@@ sure they for@@ ced on me .
why is in@@ sur@@ ance so important ?
put your pan@@ ts on .
how about st@@ op@@ ping the car and taking a re@@ st ?
I have to go to the sal@@ on and get my r@@ oo@@ t tou@@ ched up .
I re@@ cei@@ ved an inv@@ it@@ ation .
I knew you &apos;d come back to me .
you make my day so much b@@ ri@@ gh@@ ter .
do you think Tom is gu@@ il@@ ty ?
they found out .
I know who I &apos;d re@@ comm@@ end for the job .
I miss Tom .
wash your fe@@ et .
they want more sp@@ ace .
he was ready to face his f@@ ate .
why don &apos;t you put some clothes on ?
I just hope it &apos;s not too late .
s@@ it at the table .
L@@ on@@ don is large , com@@ par@@ ed with Par@@ is .
I &apos;m going out .
what do you in@@ t@@ end to do with the money ?
they made fun of my clothes .
I &apos;d like to get married .
smoking is har@@ m@@ ful to health .
would you please show me where the B@@ an@@ qu@@ e de France is lo@@ c@@ ated ?
is there a drink min@@ i@@ mu@@ m ?

the students like it .
g@@ lo@@ b@@ al war@@ m@@ ing will change the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s of the weather world @-@ wi@@ de .
what else do you know ?
they sh@@ are their same belie@@ f@@ s .
why didn &apos;t N@@ o@@ a@@ h s@@ w@@ at those two m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es ?
I didn &apos;t cat@@ ch what he said .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
Tom bought an expen@@ sive Christ@@ mas pres@@ ent for himself .
he almost never went there .
what did you want to show us ?
don &apos;t try to be a her@@ o .
in his face !
I &apos;m one of you .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bur@@ d@@ en to my parents .
are you out of your mind ?
I &apos;m in@@ side .
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
the only thing that mat@@ ters is that you wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ j@@ ured .
his be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or is very o@@ d@@ d today .
milk does not keep long in hot weather .
I like ca@@ st@@ les .
a t@@ oo@@ th@@ ac@@ he de@@ pri@@ ved me of sleep .
I &apos;ve decided .
I am free this even@@ ing .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand the ru@@ les .
I wanted to thank you for what you did today .

we bro@@ ke up .
you &apos;re very good .
sa@@ ve up so that you can go to col@@ le@@ ge .
if Tom and Mary are going to the z@@ o@@ o with you , I &apos;ll go , too .
he told me his life &apos;s story .
Tom has just finished e@@ ating dinner .
I need to know everything that you know about Tom .
not all teac@@ h@@ ers be@@ have like that .
I think it will be s@@ un@@ ny tomorrow .
yes , I think you ought to go .
go to bed !
I &apos;ve got a fl@@ as@@ h@@ light in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment .
yes , my child .
he ex@@ pla@@ ined the poli@@ ti@@ cal b@@ ac@@ k@@ gr@@ ound of the wa@@ r on TV .
we pla@@ yed ch@@ ess .
Sami decided to turn a bl@@ ind e@@ ye to the truth .
Tom had a difficult job .
that has nothing to do with it .
would you like to try it again ?
life is too sh@@ ort , really !
he fa@@ iled to come yesterday .
Tom wants to be a di@@ p@@ lo@@ m@@ at .
he went there , never to re@@ turn .
I conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated it .
I don &apos;t want to tell him .
what kind of mista@@ kes did you make ?
I wasn &apos;t the one dri@@ ving the car .
Tom p@@ at@@ ted me on the back and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated me .
P@@ e@@ ter was an al@@ tru@@ i@@ st@@ ic vi@@ de@@ o game pla@@ y@@ er ; he would give it@@ e@@ ms to people who nee@@ ded them , rather than sel@@ ling them for per@@ s@@ on@@ al prof@@ it .
that cat is bro@@ wn .
it &apos;s not poli@@ te to st@@ are at others .
she went with him to the z@@ o@@ o .
he was s@@ col@@ ded by his teacher for being la@@ zy .
I know that it is hi@@ gh@@ ly un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that we &apos;ll see any wha@@ les today .
if I have any more questions , where can I find you ?
it is about time you married .
the milk &apos;s a bit off .
my h@@ us@@ band is in j@@ a@@ il .
if I knew his ad@@ dress , I would get in touch with him right away .
Tom found something .
I had an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la with me but my friend did not .
I can &apos;t fi@@ x the se@@ at .
he ig@@ nor@@ ed her advice .
there was something off in Sami &apos;s life .
you will be pa@@ id ac@@ cor@@ ding to your ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty .
do you have much s@@ now in your country ?
you look a little gre@@ en around the g@@ il@@ ls .
the doctor has no office hours on M@@ on@@ day morning .
he is not in .
we have a break from 1@@ 0 : 4@@ 0 to 1@@ 1 : 00 .
I &apos;m leaving in ten minutes .
I de@@ e@@ p@@ ly appreciate your advice and kin@@ d@@ ness .
I heard someone sh@@ ou@@ ting .
he only works d@@ ur@@ ing the day .
Mary said that she &apos;d be late .
make up your mind already ! wh@@ e@@ ther you go in or go out , just stop op@@ ening this door !
you won &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e me .
he is f@@ lu@@ ent in Ch@@ in@@ ese .
I was expe@@ c@@ ting you at 1@@ 1 : 00 a@@ .@@ m .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
having been busy all day yesterday , I feel very tired this morning .
what do you think they &apos;ll do ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for class on the first day .
sen@@ ten@@ ces past this I@@ D are sen@@ ten@@ ces ad@@ ded by con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors of Tatoeba P@@ ro@@ ject .
he will soon be able to swim well .
when he asked who had bro@@ ken the window , all the boys put on an a@@ ir of in@@ no@@ c@@ ence .
did you miss me ?
that &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est part .
I don &apos;t know for cer@@ tain .
what time do you turn off the li@@ gh@@ ts ?
I have to say I en@@ v@@ y you .
his trou@@ b@@ les are not over .
I &apos;m not sure what it was , but it s@@ oun@@ ded like a g@@ un@@ shot .
we have a dea@@ d@@ l@@ ine .
is there some@@ where in E@@ uro@@ pe you &apos;d like to visit ?
he &apos;s a bi@@ got .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
he saw in her eyes that she still lo@@ ved him and hope ar@@ ose in@@ side him .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
I sli@@ ced the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally .
she should have kept her m@@ ou@@ th sh@@ u@@ t .
I think love does not ex@@ ist .
I guess my lu@@ ck just r@@ an out .
he pla@@ ys b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ ball best of us all .
the de@@ c@@ is@@ ion is still not de@@ fin@@ ite .
it seems she is over thir@@ ty years old .
is your father a doctor ?
I &apos;ve asked you re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly to do that .
the music car@@ ried me back to my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood .
for dinner , we went back to my place .
I had to go back .
nobody sup@@ por@@ ted my country .
I &apos;ll tell her where I went .
I just did it .
who are you sel@@ ling your car to ?
she spea@@ ks English as if she were a na@@ tive spea@@ k@@ er .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I don &apos;t like both of you going to such a place .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to live .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
I had to work over@@ time yesterday .
it &apos;ll be us three : you , me , and A@@ n@@ ne .
they acc@@ used him of telling a li@@ e .
I &apos;m sorry if I s@@ n@@ app@@ ed at you .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
last week five students were ab@@ sent from class .
Sami sp@@ illed his drink in the store .
you don &apos;t have what it ta@@ kes to be a le@@ ad@@ er .
I don &apos;t like feeling so po@@ wer@@ less .
nothing makes Tom happy .
Tom was late for dinner .
I am glad that the matter was se@@ tt@@ led am@@ ic@@ ably .
you &apos;re s@@ l@@ os@@ hed .
do you have anything to say to us ?
we pas@@ sed by the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ y before coming home .

so , why are you here ?
&quot; this is che@@ aper than a new hat , &quot; S@@ us@@ an ans@@ w@@ ered .

close your eyes , please .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you that on the phone .
I eat fr@@ u@@ it and drink water .
I didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I started the fire .
in the store , they bought the nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties and the su@@ per@@ f@@ lu@@ ous .
let &apos;s keep an e@@ ye on this .
I be@@ t you &apos;re talking about Tom .
I &apos;m sure , in the dist@@ ant future , you won &apos;t be able to for@@ give yourself .

I want to do that now .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .

the well de@@ li@@ ver@@ s a great dea@@ l of o@@ il .
I &apos;m on my way .
I remember see@@ ing her .
who is that boy ?
he didn &apos;t have time to spend with his children .
what choice did I have ?
please don &apos;t lau@@ gh at me .

don &apos;t talk to me about him .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
I didn &apos;t reali@@ ze you could speak French .
where did you get that or@@ ang@@ e s@@ car@@ f ?
the story turned my bl@@ ood cold .
because there are a lot of v@@ ol@@ can@@ o@@ es , it is easy for Japan to be h@@ it by ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes .
I &apos;m looking for people to speak E@@ sp@@ er@@ an@@ to with .
I just started cr@@ ying .
this book is too expen@@ sive .

how do you say that in French ?
I &apos;d k@@ ill for a beer right now .
Tom was w@@ ear@@ ing a wi@@ re .
who are you t@@ ex@@ ting ?
you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t read in such poor light .
would you like to eat something ?
happy is the man who is con@@ t@@ ent with his lot .
that &apos;s why I asked .
the com@@ ic books were p@@ iled on the des@@ k .
I want to play .
I &apos;m sure Tom was inv@@ ol@@ ved .
Tom has a lot of to@@ ys .
this is an old buil@@ ding .
do you believe in gh@@ os@@ ts ?
am I being acc@@ used of m@@ ur@@ der ?
I &apos;ve been very busy since the new ter@@ m started .
I &apos;m much ol@@ der than you are .
when did Tom arri@@ ve ?
I can &apos;t wait to meet him .
that &apos;s n@@ on@@ sense . nobody but a f@@ ool would believe it .
Tom is a good b@@ ass pla@@ y@@ er .
I just can &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ re it out .

if I had known about your ill@@ ness , I could have vis@@ ited you in the hospital .

how much more su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing can they en@@ du@@ re ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for work .
can you help me write a love letter ?
I haven &apos;t done this since high school .
something is wrong with this cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ or .
the story cannot be true .
did you understand what I me@@ ant by that ?
please th@@ row me the ball .
I do not like ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ s very much .

how did you come by this pain@@ ting ?
how much did they give you for your old car ?
he married a pretty girl .
I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make no@@ ise . the baby is sleeping .
how do you dea@@ l with it ?
let &apos;s wait an h@@ our .
I r@@ an into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I wonder what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I br@@ ought you another bl@@ an@@ ket .
S@@ am is two years you@@ ng@@ er than Tom .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
you are in Boston .
that &apos;s not your problem anymore .
I know that you are busy .
you are a doctor .
will the train leave on time ?
I &apos;m w@@ il@@ ling to help you if you want me to .
I don &apos;t know how to des@@ cri@@ be it .
Mary always y@@ el@@ ls when she &apos;s angry .
Tom tried to h@@ ul@@ a h@@ oo@@ p .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s you are mista@@ ken .
if the times go against you , then go with the times .
when I en@@ ter@@ ed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , she was making ch@@ ic@@ ken cur@@ ry with ri@@ ce .
I am through with my work .
who is the man sit@@ ting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents har@@ dly ever pun@@ ished me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don shi@@ p .
the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al we di@@ sch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed of his ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his le@@ gs are long .
Mary was lucky to find her ke@@ ys .
it beg@@ an to s@@ now .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a pres@@ ent for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ ose wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever you want .
I never tal@@ ked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this concer@@ t was a@@ we@@ some .
what is life without the ra@@ di@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ di@@ sp@@ u@@ table f@@ act that Americ@@ ans are , as Americ@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ di@@ cted to the belie@@ f that the other na@@ tions of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e them .
we &apos;re s@@ unk .
do not under@@ est@@ im@@ ate my po@@ wer .
I can &apos;t play ten@@ n@@ is as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ cked up .
I be@@ t you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the writ@@ er does not always pres@@ ent life as it is .
language and cu@@ l@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a ta@@ x@@ i st@@ and near the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ at@@ r@@ a &apos;s n@@ ose had been sh@@ or@@ ter , the hi@@ story of the world would be different .
his room was small but cle@@ an , and the food was good .
his slee@@ ve tou@@ ched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
S@@ m@@ ith has sp@@ ent years stud@@ ying the e@@ ffe@@ c@@ ts of sleep and sleep l@@ oss on me@@ mor@@ y and lear@@ ning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise .
the cat ru@@ ined my so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re less than hal@@ f@@ way to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you already tired ?
con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feeling down in the du@@ mp@@ s .
they &apos;re all on vac@@ ation .
if you can , come with us .
I tr@@ ust Tom &apos;s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the man@@ ag@@ er .
a c@@ row@@ d was ga@@ th@@ er@@ ing around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ b@@ er@@ cu@@ l@@ os@@ is .
it was your mistake .
it was very ru@@ de of you to say a thing like that .
these t@@ ex@@ ts were written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , not in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic .
you look fa@@ mi@@ li@@ ar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a t@@ our of Americ@@ a , st@@ op@@ ping in six ci@@ ties .
M@@ r@@ . Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no fa@@ ul@@ ts .
please si@@ g@@ n here .
I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ pa@@ ir .
take things as they are .
it is ra@@ ining now .
you &apos;re too s@@ us@@ pic@@ ious about everything .
so ta@@ st@@ y !
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
I probably should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the di@@ sh@@ cloth@@ s with the ser@@ vi@@ e@@ tt@@ es .
I thought he would be up@@ set .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the sh@@ or@@ t@@ est @-@ lived prof@@ es@@ si@@ ons there is .
the milk is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he app@@ e@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be im@@ possible to get a completely er@@ r@@ or @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us du@@ e to the nat@@ ure of this kind of col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ a@@ tive ef@@ for@@ t . H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , if we en@@ cour@@ age me@@ mb@@ ers to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te sen@@ ten@@ ces in their own languages rather than exper@@ im@@ ent in languages they are lear@@ ning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any experience of f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ ined everything .
because they &apos;re watching tele@@ vis@@ ion .
we &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
write your ad@@ dress here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a wan@@ der@@ ing pe@@ dd@@ ler .
Tom wal@@ ks s@@ low@@ ly .
keep pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing , Tom .
I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minu@@ te .
he already knows that .
all of a su@@ dd@@ en , Tom and I were alone .
th@@ an@@ ks to you , I sp@@ ent all my money .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
if you are to reali@@ ze your drea@@ m , you must work har@@ der .
I hate the ti@@ e you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing .
I like this book .
mother no@@ ted that my fe@@ et were not cle@@ an .
I really lo@@ ved you .
the girl is I@@ ri@@ sh .
please per@@ m@@ it me to ask you some questions .
I was married .
he doesn &apos;t have his medi@@ ca@@ tion .
each gen@@ er@@ ation would have to re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver for it@@ self the tru@@ ths of the past .
it go@@ es without saying that hon@@ est@@ y is the key to succ@@ ess .
time to ri@@ se and sh@@ ine .
he did it any@@ way .
the pay is terri@@ ble and the hours are long .
how old is the univer@@ se ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six mon@@ ths pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant with our first son .
this is hard for me .
they can &apos;t do that .
I miss his kis@@ s .
what are your reas@@ ons for pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ sing Ch@@ in@@ ese medi@@ c@@ ine in the U@@ K ?
the ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or asked us to turn the music down .
I tried to tell you .
I sk@@ i@@ pped out on my appoin@@ t@@ ment with my b@@ oss .
he turned his mind to it .
he was ne@@ ar@@ ly run over at a cr@@ os@@ sing .
every country has its own hi@@ story .
Tom made me read this book .
do I have to sp@@ ell it out for you ?
do you know the movie A@@ v@@ at@@ ar ?
even my b@@ oss did not con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ late me .
God hel@@ ps those who help the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves .

this gu@@ y des@@ er@@ ves a me@@ d@@ al .
do you eat it in the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room ?
never tell me a li@@ e again .

G@@ ir@@ a@@ ff@@ es have very long nec@@ ks .
the house is on fire !
I get a three per@@ cent com@@ mis@@ sion on anything I s@@ ell .

I wanted to speak with you first .
Tom ad@@ m@@ itted he had ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted a b@@ ri@@ be .
you can help .
you must pre@@ p@@ are yourself for the wor@@ st .
they think I &apos;m a mil@@ li@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re .
we mi@@ st@@ ook him for an Amer@@ i@@ can .
we must ac@@ ce@@ pt our ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence as far as possible .
I belie@@ ved you .
he li@@ ed about his age .
there is something I must know .
the bo@@ x had been da@@ mag@@ ed , but its con@@ t@@ ents were in@@ t@@ act .
the s@@ low@@ est one to make a promise is the most fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful one in kee@@ ping it .
this tele@@ phone is out of order .
I st@@ re@@ t@@ ched out my le@@ gs .
you &apos;re very kind , Tom .
I did all the work .
make it as sp@@ ic@@ y as you can .
not bad for a beg@@ in@@ ner .
Tom was looking at a pic@@ ture of Mary .
they tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
please write down what I say .
he had never for@@ gi@@ ven A@@ d@@ รฉ@@ la@@ รฏ@@ de for not having those heav@@ y brea@@ sts , those wi@@ de bu@@ t@@ to@@ c@@ ks that are a cre@@ d@@ it to fa@@ mi@@ lies .
he was an@@ x@@ ious to meet you .
we list@@ ened car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly in order not to miss a sing@@ le word .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e put on her most beautiful dress to go to the the@@ at@@ er .
don &apos;t ju@@ d@@ ge me too har@@ sh@@ ly .
how many times did you do that ?
one of you two is going to have to go there .
&quot; can I write K@@ ab@@ y@@ le at Tatoeba ? &quot; &quot; what I say b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to the o@@ live t@@ ree . the words are no longer mine . &quot;
can you see anything at all there ?
he was all wrong .
give me some time to think .
the sit@@ uation is very comp@@ li@@ c@@ ated .
you will soon get to like him .
it must be the pos@@ t@@ man .
I took part in the sp@@ or@@ ting e@@ v@@ ent .
I sy@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ i@@ ze .
I just want a little more time .
the mo@@ ment I hel@@ d the baby in my ar@@ ms , it beg@@ an to c@@ ry .

it de@@ p@@ ends on what you me@@ an .
I heard that he &apos;d died .
forget it . it &apos;s not wor@@ th it .
just reading a computer man@@ u@@ al is like pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing swimming on d@@ ry land .
please understand my pos@@ i@@ tion .
is it difficult to learn G@@ re@@ e@@ k ?
could you tell me how to ad@@ just the vo@@ lu@@ me ?
his house is by the ri@@ ver .
he &apos;s rich enough to buy two car@@ s .
Tom didn &apos;t go to the hospital .
that &apos;s where I was born .
that is a bo@@ at .
she was fin@@ ed 1@@ 0 do@@ l@@ lar@@ s for that .
I don &apos;t see how that is any of your bus@@ iness .
le@@ mon@@ s are s@@ our .
Tom may know Mary &apos;s tele@@ phone number .
you &apos;re too s@@ low .
why was Tom killed ?
I always kept my promis@@ es .
Tom wor@@ ked until 2 : 3@@ 0 .
why are you in@@ sul@@ ting me ?
since it was so hot , we went swimming .
it &apos;s the best .
one of the app@@ les fell to the gr@@ ound .
don &apos;t be afraid .
a girl was as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted on the m@@ รฉ@@ tr@@ o .

he &apos;s a fine young la@@ d .
when we ste@@ pped off the bus we were immedi@@ ately sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a thr@@ ong of children from the v@@ ill@@ age .
set Tom free .
it &apos;s re@@ gre@@ tt@@ able .

they told me that they in@@ ten@@ ded to w@@ in .
what should I do if Tom cal@@ ls ?
you have to be pre@@ par@@ ed .

more often than not , he is late for school .
the the@@ ory is too ab@@ str@@ act for me .
do you want coffee ?
she mo@@ ved to the U@@ S@@ A because her father died some mon@@ ths after you went to France .
Tom is t@@ all , but not as t@@ all as I am .
do you think it gi@@ ves me pleas@@ ure to not have time to look after my children ?
how about star@@ ting again from the very beg@@ in@@ ning ?
can you look at these two pic@@ tu@@ res and tell me which one is better ?
I &apos;m done with you .
I never said this job would be easy .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say .

Tom wants to say hel@@ l@@ o .
on the whole hu@@ man be@@ ings want to be good , but not too good and not quite all the time .
how did you get over the difficul@@ ty ?
when did you start wr@@ iting s@@ on@@ gs ?
Tom is sick .

Tom in@@ stan@@ tly fell in love with Mary .

you did well not to fol@@ low his advice .
you don &apos;t have to think you aren &apos;t going to make it just because others have fa@@ iled .
his idea looks a lot like mine .
you &apos;ll be the first to know .
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her .
he lived alone in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
Tom wants to jo@@ in our c@@ lu@@ b .
this is ir@@ re@@ gu@@ lar .
that &apos;s why I came back so soon .
not being wat@@ ch@@ ful , the dri@@ ver fa@@ iled to stop in time .

you don &apos;t need to worry about wi@@ re@@ t@@ app@@ ing .
no so@@ on@@ er had he met his family than he bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
it won &apos;t hurt you to sk@@ i@@ p one me@@ al .
I saw you with him .
don &apos;t drink so much beer .
I said sh@@ u@@ t up !
I just had a talk with your doctor .
we &apos;re looking for the tre@@ as@@ ure .

I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
I need to go there .
no one could make the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess lau@@ gh .

I don &apos;t like your sm@@ ile .
he made up his mind to mar@@ ry K@@ a@@ thy .
why did you gu@@ ys break up ?

it was the first time that I vis@@ ited the mus@@ e@@ um .
you look con@@ ten@@ ted .
I don &apos;t feel like going out .
he has pl@@ ans .
his secre@@ t@@ ary seems to know the truth .
in order to get the so@@ il ready for plan@@ ting you must p@@ low it .
how can you con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate ?
you should read books b@@ en@@ ef@@ ic@@ i@@ al to you .
I would like to have a c@@ up of coffee .
your trou@@ b@@ les are just beg@@ in@@ ning .
she is very pho@@ to@@ gen@@ ic .
this is very interest@@ ing .
do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
he can &apos;t be ill .
have I chang@@ ed that much ?
he found his ma@@ ster .
I b@@ le@@ ed easily when I am cut .
I am not e@@ ating my sal@@ ad , because I pref@@ er cho@@ co@@ late .

I wanted to let you know about that , but Tom told me not to say anything .

I think we &apos;d better take a break .
he became a pian@@ ist .
the rain has let up , so we can beg@@ in .

we must be ready for anything .
I knew then that I was right .

he was caught with his pan@@ ts down .
ap@@ art from my sister , my family doesn &apos;t watch TV .
they spo@@ ke b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly .
where do you want to sleep tonight ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I hur@@ ried so as not to miss the train .

time pas@@ ses , and it tur@@ n@@ s the wh@@ eel of life as water does that of a m@@ ill .
which way is the che@@ ese sh@@ el@@ f ?
if I told you , you wouldn &apos;t understand .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like the same kind of music .

I hope you were able to buy everything you need .
I had a really great time with your family .

they &apos;re coo@@ king now .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .

can you pay me in adv@@ ance ?
&quot; are you ser@@ ious ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tely ser@@ ious . &quot;
I fir@@ ed the gu@@ n .
O@@ h you poor little thing .
he ju@@ mp@@ ed into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an ol@@ der woman .
every mo@@ ve@@ ment is pain@@ ful .
she li@@ ked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until M@@ on@@ day .
I me@@ ant to call her , but I forgot to .
you don &apos;t look very str@@ ong .
I completely app@@ ro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer f@@ est@@ i@@ v@@ al .
they caught Tom .
she was ab@@ sent from school because she was sick .
everybody wants per@@ man@@ ent pe@@ ace .
her sor@@ row was only app@@ ar@@ ent .
J@@ an@@ e looks very p@@ al@@ e .
Tom comm@@ itted su@@ ic@@ i@@ de in pri@@ son .
Tom is a member of the S@@ W@@ A@@ T team .
they had to change their sch@@ e@@ du@@ le because the train arrived late .
&quot; qui@@ et , &quot; he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed .
you see@@ m to know everything .
in two mo@@ ves , K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v will che@@ ck the c@@ hal@@ l@@ en@@ ger .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese cu@@ l@@ ture and hi@@ story .
she looked trou@@ b@@ led by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me ner@@ v@@ ous .
do you mind much ?
it is cl@@ ou@@ dy now .
the show star@@ ts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very underst@@ an@@ ding .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she th@@ re@@ at@@ ened to set our house on fire .
the wha@@ le is well known to be the lar@@ g@@ est ma@@ m@@ mal .
that &apos;s true for every day ex@@ ce@@ pt one .
Sami knows this h@@ ood like the back of his hand .
the ri@@ s@@ ks are too great .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en C@@ ol@@ b@@ er@@ t is a pretty crazy gu@@ y .
give it back to me .
Mr S@@ m@@ ith teac@@ h@@ es me English .
the ele@@ v@@ at@@ or seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ os@@ ing wh@@ e@@ ther I should listen to reas@@ on or my feel@@ ings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that so@@ f@@ a re@@ up@@ ho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it c@@ os@@ ts 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 y@@ en , I must buy the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
he is so old that he cannot walk qu@@ ick@@ ly .
please wait a mo@@ ment .
pre@@ p@@ are yourself .
they ad@@ m@@ itted they were s@@ car@@ ed .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjo@@ y sp@@ en@@ ding time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ an@@ der up .
it &apos;s a fr@@ u@@ it .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of e@@ ating at the school ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ i@@ a .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a me@@ s@@ s@@ age ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ ple@@ ss she must feel left all by her@@ self !
as the first p@@ ack e@@ mer@@ g@@ es , the spe@@ ct@@ at@@ ors take pic@@ tu@@ res with their ca@@ mer@@ as and mo@@ b@@ ile ph@@ on@@ es .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I nee@@ ded to eat less can@@ dy .
I didn &apos;t s@@ c@@ rea@@ m .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can ex@@ pl@@ ain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy hou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a so@@ lution .
he &apos;s g@@ one into hi@@ ding .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al advis@@ er .
I am an ar@@ ti@@ st .
you should buy her new to@@ ys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ p@@ ping b@@ al@@ ls .
she is nothing to him .
J@@ u@@ li@@ an w@@ ears r@@ ound gl@@ asses like J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fir@@ ed from your last job ?
I like f@@ un@@ ny gu@@ ys .
I usu@@ ally get up at e@@ ight .
there is a big par@@ k near my school .
this des@@ k has lost one of its le@@ gs .
we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it ra@@ ins .
is it possible to de@@ ter@@ mine the di@@ a@@ me@@ ter from the c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ f@@ er@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 1@@ 0 : 00 ?
and on s@@ un@@ ny days all the pi@@ ge@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling O@@ K ?
Sami re@@ se@@ mb@@ les the s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct .
what is your number ?
we believe in a better world .
is she still sing@@ le ?
I didn &apos;t enjo@@ y the party at all .
she a@@ im@@ ed at the t@@ ar@@ get .
we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark out@@ side .
I can &apos;t read A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they ha@@ ted Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the the@@ ory that one should learn L@@ at@@ in in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being ser@@ ious !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .
please pic@@ k me up by car in fr@@ on@@ t of the hotel .
who gave you your n@@ ick@@ name ?
under nor@@ mal con@@ di@@ tions , the bo@@ il@@ ing point of water is 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my app@@ e@@ ti@@ te away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve eat@@ en in an I@@ tal@@ ian pi@@ z@@ z@@ er@@ i@@ a .
no one can den@@ y the f@@ act .
ab@@ o@@ ve all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have difficul@@ ty con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ w@@ el@@ ling on the pleas@@ u@@ res of the past .
I &apos;ll stay inv@@ ol@@ ved .
this happened pri@@ or to re@@ cei@@ ving your letter .
Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is b@@ lu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cur@@ ren@@ cy to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting .
ac@@ id rain is not a nat@@ ur@@ al ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on .
we should pre@@ ser@@ ve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more qu@@ ick@@ ly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ mp@@ et .
I think that f@@ act is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I o@@ we you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 3@@ 0 .
car@@ ry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this fa@@ ke ?
my father always rea@@ ds the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper before breakfast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already eat@@ en .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
she pla@@ ys the f@@ lu@@ te .
they look so cu@@ te together .
Tom wi@@ ped his gl@@ asses .
it really h@@ its the na@@ il on the head .
she has inter@@ na@@ tion@@ al re@@ no@@ wn as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom sli@@ p and f@@ all .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s wor@@ th lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am a@@ w@@ k@@ ward with nu@@ mb@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I buil@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ou@@ se by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concer@@ t because he had to work .
he &apos;s bro@@ ke .
she is far from hon@@ est .
there are good gr@@ oun@@ ds for the vi@@ ew that Par@@ is was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f out@@ l@@ ine of the plan .
if I were you , I would ig@@ nor@@ e it .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in this country .
I want a d@@ on@@ u@@ t .
I &apos;m in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the s@@ il@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks wor@@ ried .
I ob@@ ject to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these ha@@ ts .
we &apos;ll deci@@ de later .
last win@@ ter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with L@@ ay@@ la .
this so@@ f@@ a can se@@ at three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expe@@ ct anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel u@@ ne@@ as@@ y without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or sing@@ le ? do you live alone or are you in a re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p ?
the sk@@ y is clear . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in si@@ ght .
I &apos;m not st@@ op@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing sit@@ ting down is not all that bad .
che@@ ck these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it corre@@ ct@@ ly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s dang@@ er@@ ous for children to swim in this la@@ ke .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necess@@ ary .
an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous sp@@ ace station or@@ i@@ b@@ iting around J@@ up@@ it@@ er over@@ looked the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w st@@ ri@@ p@@ es of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the in@@ j@@ ured were re@@ mo@@ ved from the s@@ cen@@ e .
the train is arri@@ ving !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cu@@ re for what a@@ ils you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the re@@ sul@@ t .
do not be sh@@ y . your pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the a@@ ir was hu@@ m@@ id and lu@@ ke@@ war@@ m .
of cour@@ se , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost s@@ car@@ ed me not to see you on@@ l@@ ine for a whole day .
she is as fl@@ at as a pan@@ cake .
this ar@@ ti@@ cle is more interest@@ ing than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you h@@ it your children ?
beau@@ ty pleas@@ es the eyes , kin@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ an@@ ts the s@@ ou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the beg@@ in@@ ning .
I don &apos;t enjo@@ y teac@@ hing children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reas@@ ons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ en@@ ding money than is necess@@ ary .
the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his su@@ dd@@ en app@@ ear@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom r@@ an out of mat@@ ch@@ es so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ as@@ e@@ ball game .
Tom &apos;s in@@ no@@ cent .
everyone ga@@ th@@ ered together for the pic@@ ture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .
please ref@@ er to the tou@@ ri@@ st infor@@ mation office .
don &apos;t leave the fr@@ on@@ t door open .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .
it was N@@ an@@ cy where M@@ a@@ x was sup@@ posed to meet P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a .
Tom and Mary wa@@ sh@@ ed the di@@ sh@@ es together .
Tom is watching .
be@@ si@@ d@@ es the rain , we experi@@ en@@ ced heav@@ y win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ al@@ thy town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the se@@ ven s@@ ac@@ ra@@ m@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go ab@@ road .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ac@@ hing you .
does Tom still re@@ ly on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cu@@ e him .
I fi@@ g@@ ured out a way to make more money .
this job gi@@ ves me the hu@@ m@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ e@@ cy came true .
I hate people who have feel@@ ings .
have a nice wee@@ k@@ end !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; stor@@ ies . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es are en@@ g@@ ine@@ ers , but all en@@ g@@ ine@@ ers are gen@@ i@@ us@@ es . the set of all en@@ g@@ ine@@ ers is th@@ us an , un@@ fortun@@ ately pro@@ p@@ er , sub@@ set of all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom ig@@ nor@@ ed our advice .
we will be done in at most an h@@ our .
I see her laugh@@ ing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her clea@@ v@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ rel@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ing .
the only one who can sol@@ ve this problem is you .
what a beautiful ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a ner@@ v@@ ous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping secre@@ ts ?
try hard to ho@@ ld it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t s@@ ound enti@@ re@@ ly con@@ v@@ in@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the s@@ cen@@ e of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sense .
his eyes were sm@@ il@@ ing behind his gl@@ asses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pre@@ si@@ dent &apos;s new secre@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something art ?
please make five co@@ pi@@ es of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your p@@ il@@ ls ?
it s@@ no@@ w@@ ed yesterday .
don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at least thir@@ ty minutes ago .
it &apos;s not sup@@ posed to happen .
he h@@ it me tw@@ ice .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never go@@ tt@@ en a sp@@ ee@@ ding ti@@ cket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish le@@ ap@@ ed out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any b@@ ag@@ s in this sho@@ p ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very ru@@ de .
he &apos;s pain@@ ting his house .
Tom looks like a fore@@ ig@@ ner .
I had two co@@ pi@@ es of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ town .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mista@@ kes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes s@@ low .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will s@@ now tomorrow .
you &apos;re too na@@ i@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re as@@ ha@@ med of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interest@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ ths .
what year were you born ?
please dro@@ p in when you happen to be in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
he is ea@@ ger to please .
I didn &apos;t cat@@ ch your last name .
we &apos;re both w@@ it@@ ne@@ s@@ ses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a b@@ ath .
you don &apos;t have per@@ mis@@ sion to do that .
I don &apos;t need any re@@ st .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ a@@ tions .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the pati@@ ent was di@@ sch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed from hospital .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
Sami ref@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been stud@@ ying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the hospital every day but S@@ un@@ day .
she came to Japan for the p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose of stud@@ ying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ cted and im@@ pre@@ g@@ n@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ an@@ ded their fl@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ er in my b@@ ac@@ k@@ y@@ ard .
why did God cre@@ ate the univer@@ se ?
p@@ ass me the sugar , please .
that was c@@ ool .
is this one of your c@@ rea@@ tions ?
there was a heav@@ y rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I men@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having dou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ a@@ k@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wor@@ e a red bl@@ ou@@ se .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the town was fu@@ ll of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no in@@ tention of doing so .
the Ear@@ th and S@@ u@@ n are just t@@ in@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I su@@ gg@@ est we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the man in this pho@@ to ?
I want to jo@@ in your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ i@@ a in the univer@@ s@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of your@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little an@@ im@@ als .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ low@@ ing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the des@@ i@@ re for le@@ is@@ ure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ g@@ es , le@@ is@@ ure win@@ s .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you really already ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted ?
few students can read L@@ at@@ in .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I ad@@ mi@@ re your de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ a@@ de Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay sing@@ le .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to summer vac@@ ation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ ast .
is she still sing@@ le ?
she is not as beautiful as her ol@@ der sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ e@@ su@@ s .
don &apos;t do@@ d@@ ge the question .
why does Tom want this infor@@ mation ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ c@@ ks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en e@@ g@@ gs .
you mis@@ underst@@ ood me .
I don &apos;t know e@@ ither of his bro@@ thers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will ho@@ ld tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to pro@@ te@@ ct you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se ?
this should sol@@ ve all your problems .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a strang@@ er here .
someone th@@ re@@ w a ro@@ ck at him .
he kis@@ sed me on the fore@@ head .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ a didn &apos;t s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that &quot; Tom , &quot; her p@@ en @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been cor@@ respon@@ ding for mon@@ ths over the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t and wh@@ om she secre@@ tly lo@@ ved , without ever having met him , was ac@@ tually a sup@@ er @-@ in@@ tel@@ lig@@ ent s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ it@@ es un@@ less it is att@@ ac@@ ked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined that he was in@@ no@@ cent .
he is a man who is f@@ on@@ d of cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sh@@ oo@@ ting your big m@@ ou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of do@@ gs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is or@@ din@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ al@@ e as a gh@@ ost .
cat@@ ch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the ki@@ ds ?
ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y is often re@@ gar@@ ded as difficult .
the ra@@ di@@ o doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consi@@ der the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expe@@ ct him to fin@@ ish the t@@ ask in so sh@@ ort a time .
the sp@@ ace b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ mer@@ ic@@ al ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s key .
that job is im@@ possible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black bo@@ x .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s .
these two l@@ in@@ es cut ac@@ r@@ oss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dre@@ s@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s s@@ mar@@ t , hand@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your e@@ g@@ gs in one b@@ as@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in N@@ ew Y@@ or@@ k , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze for the way I ac@@ ted last night .
may you be tou@@ ched by H@@ is N@@ oo@@ dly A@@ p@@ pen@@ d@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re e@@ ating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fa@@ in@@ ted .
how much is the ex@@ pre@@ ss ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I reali@@ ze what he me@@ ant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lo@@ ts of ph@@ on@@ es .
keep your e@@ ye on the ball .
I bur@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s im@@ possible .
we love our mother almost without kno@@ w@@ ing it , without feeling it , as it is as nat@@ ur@@ al as to live .
it s@@ car@@ ed me .
when I &apos;m hot , a gl@@ ass of c@@ ool water really ref@@ re@@ sh@@ es me .
can you tell me where the ne@@ ar@@ est bus stop is ?
the ste@@ w sm@@ el@@ ls de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous .
Tom tal@@ ks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ in@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; O@@ h , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m lo@@ ved .
you still haven &apos;t finished pa@@ ying for your wa@@ sh@@ ing m@@ ac@@ h@@ ine ?
there is a ro@@ ck in my sho@@ e .
this dog will pro@@ te@@ ct us .
Tom is a di@@ ve ma@@ ster .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teac@@ h you something .
it &apos;s un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ able to d@@ ate such a bro@@ ken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side d@@ ur@@ ing this pain@@ ful or@@ dea@@ l .
look at this me@@ ss .
he is anything but a re@@ li@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is so@@ lu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to me@@ mor@@ i@@ ze the for@@ mu@@ l@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you expe@@ ct to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is f@@ lu@@ ent in German , but with a s@@ light Amer@@ i@@ can acc@@ ent .
she always expe@@ c@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ la@@ in in b@@ att@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to b@@ la@@ me you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a ha@@ mmer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I re@@ ac@@ hed the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
what &apos;s your fin@@ al de@@ st@@ in@@ ation ?
once up@@ on a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a boo@@ k@@ kee@@ p@@ er compu@@ tes all the company &apos;s in@@ come and expen@@ ses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bo@@ ther anymore .
he has a vi@@ de@@ o .
I &apos;m a woman , in c@@ ase you &apos;re won@@ der@@ ing .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can re@@ comm@@ end this restaurant .
the e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ e was es@@ cor@@ ted off the pre@@ mis@@ es .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
K@@ ate has been gi@@ ven an op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to play a ma@@ j@@ or ro@@ le in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the st@@ ra@@ ight p@@ ath .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was dis@@ appoin@@ ted at my answer .
we re@@ no@@ v@@ ated a house .
who ta@@ ught you French ?
you &apos;re the pre@@ t@@ ti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ru@@ ined it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teac@@ h me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you me@@ an .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , I already have pl@@ ans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was de@@ v@@ a@@ st@@ ated by water .
I have pl@@ en@@ ty of friends .
exc@@ use me , but I think this is my se@@ at .
this is an op@@ ti@@ cal ill@@ us@@ ion .
let &apos;s mo@@ ve !
it was a g@@ am@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she tra@@ vel@@ s ab@@ road .
why does Tom have a gu@@ n ?
you tou@@ ched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
exc@@ use me si@@ r , could you tell me where the place of the c@@ ine@@ m@@ a lo@@ c@@ ated ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ig@@ nor@@ e him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a dr@@ unk l@@ ying on the road .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is be@@ coming more and more comp@@ li@@ c@@ ated .
every day you should at least listen to a sh@@ ort s@@ ong , read a good po@@ e@@ m , look at a beautiful pic@@ ture , and , if possible , say se@@ ver@@ al in@@ tel@@ lig@@ ent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living some@@ where else .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was fam@@ ous for its h@@ ang@@ ing gar@@ den@@ s .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the en@@ e@@ my dro@@ pped many bo@@ mb@@ s on the f@@ ac@@ t@@ ory .

did you understand any of that ?
I have no words .
don &apos;t forget to answer his letter .
don &apos;t forget to br@@ ing k@@ it@@ ch@@ en u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils such as k@@ ni@@ ves and coo@@ king po@@ ts .
no , that &apos;s not true . Tom didn &apos;t change his name . it &apos;s just a ru@@ m@@ our .
you dea@@ d .
it was a close game .
whose is the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary on the table ?
just be@@ have your@@ sel@@ ves .
after lunch we have two more cl@@ asses .
she &apos;s b@@ right and ar@@ ti@@ cu@@ late .
I &apos;ve never been to a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ as@@ e@@ ball game .
we got al@@ ong fam@@ ously .
the cap@@ ital of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il is B@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ li@@ a .
where did you go ?
he decided to have the op@@ er@@ ation .
N@@ a@@ o@@ m@@ i has just finished her work .
he married my cou@@ s@@ in .
I had a hard time trying to per@@ su@@ a@@ de him to can@@ ce@@ l the trip .
she is very sh@@ y and feel@@ s ill at e@@ ase at par@@ ties .
I feel b@@ les@@ sed .
in the late 2@@ 0@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y , Y@@ u@@ g@@ os@@ la@@ vi@@ a was consi@@ dered a ro@@ gu@@ e st@@ ate by the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .

your face is always di@@ r@@ ty .

I &apos;ll fi@@ x a drink .
I &apos;d be dis@@ appoin@@ ted if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had known that , we would &apos;ve come so@@ on@@ er .
I can &apos;t be man@@ i@@ pu@@ l@@ ated .
what do you think of his su@@ gg@@ est@@ ion ?
open those do@@ ors !
didn &apos;t you read the man@@ u@@ al ?
he wants a pla@@ y@@ m@@ ate .
she sp@@ ends all of her money on clothes .
Dan &apos;s me@@ s@@ s@@ age was in@@ sul@@ ting .
we wouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .

I know you did this .
that looks like the work of a vir@@ us .
fu@@ ck your m@@ om , b@@ it@@ ch .
he who is not sa@@ tis@@ fied with a little , is sa@@ tis@@ fied with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a different t@@ ack ?
I have been wan@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just kno@@ ck on the door ?
in France , where the s@@ ite was f@@ oun@@ ded , Tatoeba has become a cu@@ l@@ tur@@ al and so@@ ci@@ al ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on .
I speak K@@ ur@@ man@@ j@@ i .
I have to be home tonight before it ge@@ ts dark .

I left it un@@ lo@@ cked .
go s@@ it in the car .
when I g@@ row up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ v@@ able person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ick@@ name ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s R@@ ic@@ k . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere in others &apos; af@@ fa@@ irs .
you can f@@ ool all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot f@@ ool all the people all the time .
the pres@@ sure is buil@@ ding .
close the fu@@ c@@ king door !
he is interested in music .
reading books is my ho@@ b@@ by .
I like my st@@ ea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lucky .
Tom spea@@ ks French very f@@ lu@@ en@@ tly .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , that hasn &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll cost around thir@@ ty do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s gu@@ it@@ ar is new .
Tom was lucky .
the little ki@@ ds were very cu@@ ri@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ it@@ u@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these sho@@ es are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other con@@ di@@ tion ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I ad@@ m@@ it that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the pla@@ y@@ ers on this team are all gi@@ an@@ ts .
this one is the wor@@ st .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secre@@ t we@@ ap@@ on .
you won &apos;t be dis@@ appoin@@ ted .
it was so still that you would have heard a p@@ in dro@@ p .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very glad to hear the news .
Dan sp@@ ent the night having se@@ x with L@@ in@@ d@@ a .
don &apos;t use your rea@@ l name .
this book is really small !
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are cu@@ te .
I &apos;m never happ@@ i@@ er than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book wor@@ th reading is wor@@ th reading tw@@ ice .
was anybody hurt ?
it &apos;s dou@@ ble pleas@@ ure to de@@ cei@@ ve the de@@ cei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an , too .
get the fu@@ ck out !
he enjo@@ ys good health .
all the s@@ we@@ et talk was just a r@@ use to get her into bed .
M@@ i@@ h@@ o pla@@ ys pian@@ o better than N@@ or@@ i@@ k@@ o .
it me@@ ans that he likes you .
I knew it would happen so@@ on@@ er or later .
Tom is rea@@ l cu@@ te .
they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to sp@@ ell that word .
is this all yours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his r@@ ac@@ ist i@@ dea@@ s to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold weather , but Tom does .
the cap@@ tain inv@@ ited her for breakfast .
I live here alone .
did you gu@@ ys h@@ ook up ?
there &apos;s really nothing more we can do .
I can &apos;t for@@ give him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody help him .
Mary sin@@ gs best of all of the girls in class .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !
do you want help with that ?
I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
I &apos;m talking n@@ on@@ sense .
you don &apos;t see@@ m to reali@@ ze how ser@@ ious this is .
Tom won &apos;t bo@@ ther you anymore .
why did you come here today ?
that &apos;s more re@@ cent than you think it is .
how can I up@@ lo@@ ad a pho@@ to to your we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me .
Tom has bro@@ wn hair .
they lo@@ ad@@ ed the tru@@ ck .
it was c@@ row@@ ded here all last week .
the A@@ T@@ M has s@@ wal@@ lowed my de@@ bit c@@ ard .
did you st@@ ea@@ l that car ?
my grand@@ father was born in 1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 0 .
O@@ h ! is it true ?
our first d@@ ate was kind of a@@ w@@ k@@ ward . I was really ner@@ v@@ ous .
I have to write a letter . do you have some p@@ aper ?
women usu@@ ally live longer than men .
I didn &apos;t understand .
he couldn &apos;t go out because of the s@@ now .
the first b@@ low is half the b@@ att@@ le .
how old was Tom when he started talking ?
I wear gl@@ asses only for reading .
I &apos;ll get ri@@ d of them .
the ver@@ di@@ ct was a b@@ it@@ ter p@@ ill to s@@ wal@@ low .
he stu@@ died very hard .
S@@ h@@ in@@ ob@@ u is really per@@ si@@ st@@ ent . it seems that I am be@@ at@@ en .
today , there isn &apos;t any sal@@ ad , but only a large por@@ tion of f@@ rench fri@@ es .
some s@@ na@@ kes are po@@ is@@ on@@ ous .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to touch him .
I &apos;m bro@@ ke and tired .
I usu@@ ally take a sho@@ wer after I play ten@@ n@@ is , but today I couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been a big help .
everybody is sleeping .
I haven &apos;t seen him lat@@ ely .

Tom wants to say yes , but he can &apos;t .
you must listen .
he was be@@ at@@ en too easily .
they sle@@ pt in the same bed .
I &apos;ve never seen you so happy .
you &apos;re not the only one .
come on , answer qu@@ ick@@ ly .

would you mind if I kis@@ sed you ?
in English there are some words bor@@ row@@ ed from Japanese .
Sami will spend life behind bar@@ s .
we &apos;re going to keep doing this until someone tel@@ ls us that we can &apos;t .
how could you say something like that ?
B@@ a@@ ma@@ k@@ o is M@@ al@@ i &apos;s cap@@ ital .
the P@@ resi@@ dent of France will visit Japan next month .

do you app@@ ro@@ ve of what he is doing ?
your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se has ex@@ p@@ ir@@ ed .
it is not you but her that he wants to mar@@ ry .
no one knows where he lives .
I like to fish in the ri@@ ver .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .
I &apos;m ready to f@@ ight .
it &apos;s sometimes necess@@ ary not to tell the truth .
what on ear@@ th is an inter@@ ro@@ b@@ an@@ g โฝ
you &apos;re not bad looking e@@ ither .
what is wrong with him ?
it &apos;s not his st@@ y@@ le .

I appreciate what you did for me .
Tom gre@@ w up in a small f@@ is@@ hing v@@ ill@@ age .

N@@ o@@ wa@@ days many people tra@@ vel by car .
come on , tell her !
I thought you were a friend .

he is afraid of the dog .
your fri@@ es are getting cold .
clear off the table .
we know you &apos;re interested .
who will pay ?
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
he &apos;s sleeping off last night &apos;s b@@ en@@ der .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between l@@ in@@ en and w@@ ool .
people can easily start lo@@ ving , but not so easily stop .
N@@ ar@@ a is a city which I like very much .
we made a good team .
there wer@@ en &apos;t many boys at the pic@@ n@@ ic .
he spea@@ ks bro@@ ken French .
I &apos;m in love .
he met his wife on@@ l@@ ine .
I no longer remember him .
this is a secre@@ t .
there was a cur@@ tain which was co@@ ver@@ ing the door .
there is no dou@@ b@@ t .
if I could I would immedi@@ ately stop .
thank you for st@@ op@@ ping by .
miss S@@ m@@ ith is li@@ ked by all students .
you are r@@ ap@@ ac@@ ious .
close the b@@ loo@@ dy door .
is there any sal@@ t left ?
the prof@@ ess@@ or see@@ med to be lost in thought .
is that right ?
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
I sle@@ pt the re@@ st of the day .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
I &apos;m glad to be the one who tel@@ ls you .
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
how we@@ ir@@ d is that ?
please play something by C@@ ho@@ p@@ in for me .
she left France for Americ@@ a .
no one knows the f@@ act .
I &apos;m 1@@ 7 , too .
we &apos;ll start again in the morning .
there &apos;s no sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of work around here .
you can &apos;t w@@ in them all .
have you ever pla@@ yed b@@ as@@ e@@ ball ?
it is not easy to be underst@@ ood by everybody .
I &apos;ll hurry .
no one can stop me from going there .
they have one too .
why is she sul@@ king ?
my a@@ un@@ t tre@@ at@@ s me as if I were a child .
she fa@@ iled and felt hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ated .

P@@ y@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as &apos; the@@ o@@ re@@ m al@@ lo@@ ws you to cal@@ cu@@ late the l@@ en@@ g@@ th of the h@@ y@@ p@@ ot@@ en@@ use of a right tri@@ ang@@ le .
I just need to know what happened .
he ro@@ b@@ bed an old la@@ dy .
who &apos;s to say which is better ?
I don &apos;t take it per@@ s@@ on@@ ally .
I went to wash my hands .
you are talking .
why would you want to do that ?
Tom bo@@ iled some water .
you &apos;re up@@ set .
my heart s@@ ank .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
I an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated trouble .
life is very sh@@ ort .
language , as we know it , is a hu@@ man in@@ ven@@ tion .
that is a p@@ ag@@ o@@ d@@ a .
is this going to ca@@ use us any problems ?
the rain was dri@@ ving in our f@@ ac@@ es .
I &apos;ll give them to you as a r@@ ough gu@@ i@@ de .
my sto@@ m@@ ach started g@@ row@@ ling right there in the meeting . it was e@@ mb@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sing .
he wrote down her name in the no@@ te@@ book .
I got here a little early today .
Tom has in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed the po@@ wer of his bi@@ ke .
how many m@@ os@@ qu@@ es are there in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l ?
I &apos;ll spend Christ@@ mas with my family .
does this hurt ?
she doesn &apos;t speak much .
she knew too much .
he exc@@ el@@ s all his bro@@ thers in s@@ cho@@ la@@ st@@ ic ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
the doctor at@@ ten@@ ded to the sick old man all night , p@@ our@@ ing shot after shot of wh@@ is@@ key into the old man &apos;s open m@@ ou@@ th until he died .
Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be pun@@ ished ; he didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you &apos;ve got to learn to be careful .
&quot; thank you . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re w@@ el@@ come . &quot;
you mis@@ sed the meeting .
I left the ke@@ ys in the ig@@ ni@@ tion .
where is the to@@ i@@ let ?
can I buy only the l@@ en@@ ses ?
it &apos;s one thing to speak a language ; teac@@ hing it is a whole new ball game .
you don &apos;t s@@ ound con@@ v@@ in@@ ced .
what a z@@ er@@ o !
to my thinking , bus@@ iness is im@@ pro@@ ving .
have fun ! see you in an h@@ our .
I want to know what I can do right now .
English has a lot of i@@ di@@ o@@ ma@@ tic ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons to off@@ er .
I have to dress up .
call me if you need as@@ si@@ st@@ ance .
do you have a cr@@ ush on my brother ?
I &apos;ve chang@@ ed . I &apos;m not the same man I used to be .
he will call for me about six .
don &apos;t let your feel@@ ings show .
I want to have se@@ x with her .
he was sub@@ je@@ cted to t@@ or@@ ture by the poli@@ ce .
Tom st@@ op@@ ped me from leaving the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
she fell head over he@@ el@@ s from the la@@ d@@ der .
they are pr@@ ou@@ d of their cle@@ ver son .
put that in wr@@ iting .
I &apos;ll get you .
we all have a ten@@ den@@ cy to think that the world must con@@ for@@ m to our pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces . the op@@ pos@@ ite vi@@ ew inv@@ ol@@ ves some ef@@ for@@ t of thought , and most people would di@@ e so@@ on@@ er than think - in f@@ act they do so .
this isn &apos;t sup@@ posed to be happ@@ ening .
who dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed ra@@ di@@ um ?
I know Tom is done .
I believe this man is lost .
Tom fell in love with the char@@ ac@@ ters in his no@@ vel .
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .
since his app@@ ear@@ ance has completely chang@@ ed , you probably won &apos;t re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze him .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t really have much in comm@@ on .
it &apos;s here .
sci@@ ence will not sol@@ ve all of our problems .
he came in through the window .
the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the lo@@ ad @-@ be@@ ar@@ ing be@@ am com@@ promis@@ ed the stru@@ c@@ ture of the buil@@ ding .
I will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to my parents .
I knew this was going to happen .
he de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed much time to study .
no one &apos;s watching .
you come from S@@ we@@ d@@ en .
my poor English cost me my job .
I don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to give you per@@ mis@@ sion .
don &apos;t be dis@@ gu@@ sting .
she &apos;s vi@@ ol@@ ent right now . it &apos;d be better to a@@ vo@@ id her .
take care of your@@ sel@@ ves !
a pi@@ e@@ ce of cho@@ co@@ late a day kee@@ ps the doctor away .
I &apos;ve been working on this all day .
I &apos;d like to see her back .
C@@ o@@ c@@ a @-@ C@@ ol@@ a in@@ ven@@ ted F@@ an@@ t@@ a , in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the S@@ e@@ con@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , for the German mar@@ ket .
what &apos;s the point of your question ?
I s@@ wear I &apos;ve never hurt Tom .
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
I was about to leave my house when she called .
don &apos;t you know who that is ?
she wat@@ ched him swim .
I de@@ e@@ p@@ ly re@@ gre@@ t having ca@@ used the accident .
she ta@@ kes after her mother in every resp@@ ect .
I don &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther you like her or not .
are you a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding me ?
I &apos;m not an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
I think we need a doctor .
it &apos;s not a question of good or bad but of better or wor@@ se .
she married a rich old man .
he wrote a lot of books on Ch@@ in@@ a .
this m@@ oun@@ tain is com@@ posed of mo@@ l@@ as@@ se , which is par@@ tly co@@ ver@@ ed by mor@@ a@@ ine mat@@ er@@ i@@ al .
some of them did very little work .
the room is quite small .
br@@ ush your t@@ ee@@ th pro@@ per@@ ly before going to bed .
she will always be there .
why are you so s@@ car@@ ed ? it &apos;s just a movie .
he asked me point @-@ bl@@ ank to help him .
he &apos;s afraid to dance .
I have got a question .
Tom is d@@ ating a Ch@@ in@@ ese ex@@ change student .
I have no mind to go for a walk .
this young cou@@ ple is in love .
In@@ se@@ c@@ ts have a hard sk@@ in .

Tom wa@@ sh@@ es clothes three times a week .
I had enough sense to get out of there .
do you feel gu@@ il@@ ty ?
I &apos;ll talk .
your face is red .
it doesn &apos;t matter , right ?
Tom isn &apos;t a student .
we have no choice but to car@@ ry on .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t mind even if she doesn &apos;t come .
the dog is cr@@ un@@ ching a b@@ one .
when did you find out ?
her feel@@ ings were not reci@@ pro@@ c@@ ated .
his reas@@ on for not going is still un@@ clear .
I &apos;m at a l@@ oss for words .

Mary is a party girl .
maybe I &apos;ll go swimming after school .
this is the cra@@ z@@ i@@ est thing I &apos;ve ever seen .
you aren &apos;t going to c@@ ry , are you ?
his am@@ bi@@ tion made him work hard .
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .
read your book .
Americ@@ a is often ref@@ er@@ red to as a m@@ el@@ ting po@@ t .
do you think your car will make it ?
the poli@@ ce@@ man shot into the a@@ ir .
I don &apos;t want to go to the p@@ ool .
which one would you take ?
do you mind if I try this on ?
he tal@@ ks as if he knew the secre@@ t .
she has the c@@ la@@ p .
how far away do you think that shi@@ p is ?
I like stor@@ ies that have sa@@ d en@@ d@@ ings .
my father will be back at the beg@@ in@@ ning of next month .
my father bought me a bicycle .
I knew you couldn &apos;t do it .
I feel like I &apos;m always in a hurry .

I can &apos;t believe you ac@@ tually did something like that .
he is trying hard to qu@@ it smoking
I &apos;m not a mon@@ ster .
Tom o@@ w@@ es Mary thir@@ ty do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .

I need more infor@@ mation on this matter .
I &apos;ve never tried .
they ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ed the lo@@ v@@ ely s@@ cen@@ er@@ y .
I &apos;ve read the book in one go .
che@@ ck it out !
nobody but you can make me happy .
the f@@ act is that I have no money with me .
the c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces gave col@@ or to her story .
how did your sp@@ ee@@ ch go ?
he was afraid that he might hurt her feel@@ ings .
how do you like my new su@@ it ?
he doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
if it ge@@ ts bor@@ ing , I will go home .
thank you for your love .
have you ever opened this door ?
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to hear@@ ing from you .

what is this bir@@ d called ?
br@@ ush your t@@ ee@@ th corre@@ ct@@ ly before going to bed .
there are some differ@@ en@@ ces between B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh English and Amer@@ i@@ can English .
the people can always be br@@ ought to the bi@@ d@@ ding of the le@@ ad@@ ers . that is easy . all you have to do is tell them they are being att@@ ac@@ ked and den@@ oun@@ ce the p@@ ac@@ i@@ fi@@ sts for l@@ ack of p@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ tis@@ m and ex@@ pos@@ ing the country to dang@@ er . it works the same way in any country .

Christ@@ mas is only three wee@@ ks off .
I don &apos;t know my father &apos;s an@@ nu@@ al in@@ come .
come and see me .
just give it a shot .
may I ask you to do me a fav@@ or ?
it ha@@ dn &apos;t cr@@ os@@ sed my mind .
Tom didn &apos;t look very well .
I &apos;m not married .
I &apos;d heard you &apos;d chang@@ ed .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions about what you did last wee@@ k@@ end .
today we must do what everyone else will do tomorrow .
Tom knows he will be pun@@ ished .
did you visit the T@@ o@@ wer of L@@ on@@ don ?
the an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er spo@@ ke English .
I &apos;ve tried .
there were no problems .
how can you be so c@@ ru@@ el ?
I &apos;ll keep it for her .
there &apos;s nothing as pre@@ ci@@ ous as love .
I &apos;d like to make a sp@@ ee@@ ch .
I had no al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive .
maybe we should start .
A@@ h , that &apos;s life !
both v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory and de@@ fe@@ at are but an every@@ day o@@ cc@@ ur@@ ren@@ ce to a sol@@ di@@ er .
did you find what you were looking for ?
he thinks I &apos;m je@@ al@@ ous .
there were no cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers , so we clos@@ ed the sho@@ p early .
she likes being looked at by boys .
have you wor@@ ked the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le out ?
we don &apos;t always agree .
he den@@ i@@ ed having said such a thing .
you know I hate that .
R@@ u@@ g@@ by is an out@@ door game .
there is more pleas@@ ure in lo@@ ving than in being lo@@ ved .
Mary w@@ ears a sp@@ or@@ ts br@@ a for ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise .
is Tom a w@@ it@@ ness ?
you &apos;ll get another chance .
who bur@@ ned the cake ?
why didn &apos;t you call me up ?
I have to pay more at@@ tention to myself .
everyone in the class learned the po@@ e@@ m by heart .
which univer@@ s@@ ity do you think T@@ ed will go to ?
you need to eat something before you go to work .
the f@@ re@@ ight train was hel@@ d up about half an h@@ our because of a den@@ se fo@@ g .
Tom knows that won &apos;t work .
I &apos;m fl@@ ab@@ by .
may I ask you something ?
does Tom like Mary ?
he was sick , so he couldn &apos;t att@@ end the party .
I want that .
who do you like better , S@@ ac@@ hi@@ k@@ o or A@@ ki@@ k@@ o ?
the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es were dog @-@ ear@@ ed .
I &apos;m sa@@ ving as much as I can .
he was st@@ ri@@ ct with his children .
here he comes .
you &apos;re in no dang@@ er .
the doctor advis@@ ed me not to eat too much .
she got up at se@@ ven in the morning .
I wear a su@@ it , but not a ti@@ e .
we will e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y a man who can speak English .
the baby is sleeping .
he asked questions at r@@ and@@ om .
that &apos;s too hard .
tell Tom what Mary told you .
I can &apos;t tell you what an hon@@ or this is .
Tom dr@@ ank a gl@@ ass of water .
he took the w@@ ood and sa@@ w@@ ed it using the saw .
B@@ i@@ ga@@ my is when you have one wife too many .
there &apos;s no question of bot@@ ching this job . it must be done well .
you are tal@@ ler than she .
it was a busy night .
he was tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ ted to the hospital by he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter .
I get dre@@ s@@ sed and then I will take my breakfast .
he killed himself by taking po@@ is@@ on .
people are talking .
they said they &apos;re thir@@ st@@ y .
an@@ im@@ als are not to@@ ys !
she &apos;s an@@ no@@ ying and sel@@ fish .
I f@@ ly into a r@@ age easily .
I have no will po@@ wer when it comes to di@@ eting .
ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes can o@@ c@@ cu@@ r at any h@@ our .
I know your problem .
would you mind taking a pic@@ ture of us ?
I believe she &apos;s 4@@ 0 years old .
he was the first to help him .
can I get you something to drink ?
please give me a c@@ up of water .
you don &apos;t look very good .
I know Tom is in .
you must be fri@@ en@@ dly with your ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s .
they are app@@ ro@@ ac@@ hing .
I &apos;m used to being laugh@@ ed at .
the man a@@ im@@ ed a gu@@ n at the poli@@ ce@@ man .
ro@@ p@@ es sur@@ r@@ ound the place .
I guess you think you &apos;re pretty spe@@ ci@@ al , don &apos;t you ?
the sho@@ p was clos@@ ed .
Tom s@@ wa@@ m with the man@@ at@@ e@@ es .
got it ?
B@@ ur@@ m@@ a is called &quot; M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r &quot; in B@@ ur@@ me@@ se .
I &apos;d like to try it on .
what does U@@ S@@ B st@@ and for ?
do you have a p@@ en I could use ?
what Mary did did not please me .
there are a few y@@ ac@@ h@@ ts on the cal@@ m se@@ a .
g@@ oo@@ d@@ b@@ ye !
my fa@@ ith in the next gen@@ er@@ ation is in@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
how do we find out what we need to know ?
but go@@ dd@@ am@@ m@@ it where did I put those re@@ char@@ ge@@ able b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies ?
I met Tom when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
I don &apos;t have any choice .
most A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ ans are I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ sts , some show it but others will hi@@ de it .
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast .
he will do his best to fin@@ ish it on time .
we don &apos;t care what he does .
now I &apos;m wi@@ de a@@ wake .
we must ref@@ le@@ ct on our fa@@ il@@ ure .
who is your fav@@ our@@ ite Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ b@@ er ?
his dog app@@ ear@@ ed su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly from behind the door .
I can &apos;t get al@@ ong with him .
my d@@ ad &apos;s name is Fr@@ it@@ z .
it &apos;s O@@ K with me .
it didn &apos;t work for me e@@ ither .
they saw us yesterday .
F@@ red took a li@@ king to J@@ an@@ e and they started see@@ ing each other .
Tom makes de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous coo@@ ki@@ es .
I &apos;d like to use a safe .
it could just be your i@@ mag@@ in@@ ation .
and it la@@ sted until early morning .
who could b@@ la@@ me him ?
he wi@@ gg@@ led his to@@ es .
I found the love of my life .
do you want to s@@ it next to the window ?
that was probably what in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ ced their de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
the Ger@@ m@@ ans have won again .
are there any other op@@ tions ?
you don &apos;t know that .
they do it fa@@ ster than me .
b@@ ite your ton@@ gu@@ e .
I can &apos;t promise you anything .
we won &apos;t have enough time to do that before Tom ge@@ ts here .
Tom t@@ os@@ sed another lo@@ g on the fire .
I can re@@ place him .
I am still young .
they are .
I think I know what this is .
a h@@ en la@@ id an e@@ g@@ g in my clos@@ et .
the to@@ ma@@ to is a ve@@ ge@@ table , not a fr@@ u@@ it .
wh@@ er@@ ever Mary go@@ es , the sh@@ ee@@ p fol@@ lo@@ ws her .
please don &apos;t go home .
keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health .
this movie is really s@@ c@@ ary .
it has been fine for a week .
he must find work .
I am sorry if I am bo@@ th@@ er@@ ing you .
I like watching TV .
we get app@@ li@@ ca@@ tions from every@@ where .
Tom asked Mary to s@@ wee@@ p the flo@@ or .
speaking about love is making love .
they will agree on that .
you &apos;re dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al .
I don &apos;t know what your problem is .
what &apos;s your e @-@ ma@@ il ad@@ dress ?
Tom has what it ta@@ kes to be a good teacher .
she is very f@@ on@@ d of wr@@ iting po@@ e@@ ms .
I hope that you aren &apos;t afraid .
I l@@ ent Tom my ca@@ mer@@ a .
am I the only one ?
would you like to come ?
Tom is poor , but he &apos;s happy .
our car is being re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed at the au@@ to sho@@ p .
there was a par@@ a@@ de to mar@@ k the o@@ cc@@ as@@ ion .
who sent you ?
my son isn &apos;t the only one who enjo@@ ys e@@ ating her coo@@ king .
I just need to be alone .
have you any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re too f@@ at .
I know that he &apos;s reading .
Tom died a few days later .
I won &apos;t come tomorrow .
I just don &apos;t want to believe it .
the station is three k@@ il@@ o@@ me@@ ters away from here .
don &apos;t ask questions , just come with me .
don &apos;t b@@ ra@@ ke su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly .
I won &apos;t be coming until four o &apos;@@ clock .
I bought this hat when I was in Boston .
I agree with everything you just said .
what do you think of this red hat ?
this is not about money .
your con@@ du@@ ct is per@@ fe@@ ct@@ ly le@@ g@@ al .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
my family isn &apos;t such a big family .
he &apos;s w@@ ear@@ ing sk@@ in@@ ny je@@ ans and a t@@ ank top .
I don &apos;t know how Tom got my phone number .
we wer@@ en &apos;t all that busy .
are you exc@@ ited ?
she looks very happy .
the end of the er@@ a of pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um is in si@@ ght .
what does a w@@ ol@@ f eat ?
I want ven@@ ge@@ ance .
that is not what I me@@ ant to say .
you &apos;re fir@@ ed .
Tom can swim no more than a st@@ one can .
do we need a P@@ l@@ an B ?
is there something I can do for you ?
I think Tom has been very lucky .
he gave the im@@ pres@@ sion of having much money .
it &apos;s st@@ able because all the r@@ oo@@ ts of this e@@ qu@@ ation are ne@@ ga@@ tive .
could you please fi@@ x this ?
we speak English in class .
happy bir@@ thday !
well , it &apos;s time for me to run off . B@@ ye !
are you ready for Y@@ 2@@ K ?
I &apos;ve just eat@@ en some s@@ us@@ h@@ i and dr@@ unk a beer .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
do you think the weather will be fine tomorrow ?
at that time , my house was under con@@ stru@@ ction .
I hate hospital food .
the boys set up a ho@@ ck@@ ey r@@ in@@ k on the f@@ ro@@ z@@ en p@@ on@@ d .
I will act on your advice .
don &apos;t touch my stu@@ f@@ f .
he is not a teacher , much less a s@@ cho@@ lar .
Tom is your un@@ cle .
I still have another sister .
&quot; what &apos;s happ@@ ening ? , &quot; m@@ ur@@ m@@ ured a vo@@ ice from the other end of the room .
I &apos;m good at playing the pian@@ o .
we &apos;re in char@@ ge .
you &apos;re the only one who underst@@ an@@ ds me .
how would you de@@ fine &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; ?
I have not more than three th@@ ous@@ and y@@ en .
I &apos;m not a per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ist .
I don &apos;t listen to them .
I just had to see you gu@@ ys before I left .
please have a se@@ at .
I hope Tom laugh@@ ed at your jo@@ kes .
men are born and re@@ ma@@ in free and e@@ qu@@ al in ri@@ gh@@ ts .
he had one daughter .
he was surprised too .
I &apos;m not your ma@@ id .
it has been ra@@ ining since S@@ un@@ day .
I cannot af@@ for@@ d long vac@@ a@@ tions .
he has a will of st@@ eel .
Tom f@@ row@@ ned .
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job .
he was im@@ pres@@ sed .
that was s@@ we@@ et of you .
L@@ u@@ ck@@ ily the door was open .
I should &apos;ve war@@ ned you .
I want to k@@ ill you right now .
you &apos;re pretty good .
he left his mother and his girlfriend in France .
how many students have been ad@@ m@@ itted to the school this year ?
she is sing@@ ing the lat@@ est popu@@ lar s@@ on@@ gs .
the dog ni@@ pped at me .
that &apos;s a very old saying .
M@@ ay@@ u@@ k@@ o was tired to death .
you must not think about your immedi@@ ate prof@@ it only .
I still haven &apos;t eat@@ en today .
he &apos;s a con@@ tro@@ l f@@ rea@@ k .
you &apos;ve often said so yourself .
you are not my mother .
she is qui@@ et .
on the first p@@ age of the secon@@ d ch@@ ap@@ ter there are many new words .
don &apos;t speak un@@ less you &apos;re spo@@ ken to .
they mi@@ st@@ ook my poli@@ ten@@ ess for fri@@ en@@ d@@ shi@@ p .
have you been having fun ?
I am now in an old ca@@ st@@ le .
here &apos;s a to@@ we@@ l you can use .
in a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , it is important that the pre@@ ss be in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent .
when I see this pic@@ ture , I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of our ho@@ li@@ day .
we are living in the ato@@ mi@@ c age .
I cannot app@@ ro@@ ve the pro@@ ject .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t think that .
you &apos;re leaving already ?
the poli@@ ce caught the th@@ i@@ e@@ f .
C@@ en@@ tr@@ al Par@@ k is near where I work .
I don &apos;t need a lo@@ an anymore .
I think that he &apos;s probably not a bad boy .
I fin@@ ally found out what was wrong with my TV .
we &apos;ve all done things we &apos;re as@@ ha@@ med of .
it took a long time to br@@ ing him around to our point of vi@@ ew .
were you hurt ?
the P@@ op@@ e has no right to mar@@ ry .
my mon@@ key r@@ an away !
you &apos;re the best sin@@ ger I know .
this con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ or has asked for adv@@ an@@ ced con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ or st@@ at@@ us . please feel free to sh@@ are your opinion with us . s@@ end us a me@@ s@@ s@@ age using the fol@@ low@@ ing l@@ in@@ k .

my mother is very d@@ ear to me .
don &apos;t leave me !
I o@@ we a lot of people an ap@@ olo@@ gy .
he in@@ stan@@ tly fell in love with her .
M@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously , nobody was ser@@ i@@ ously in@@ j@@ ured .
that &apos;s a good story . the only problem is that it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not one of them .
Tom and Mary really lo@@ ved each other .
what is it you do ?
the S@@ mi@@ ths are our cou@@ sin@@ s .
C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a app@@ e@@ al@@ ed to the Un@@ ited N@@ a@@ tions for help .
I &apos;m from K@@ yo@@ to .
he became a great mus@@ ic@@ ian .
my house f@@ ac@@ es the se@@ a .
have you put on we@@ ight ?
W@@ a@@ x the flo@@ or .
I ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze if I off@@ en@@ ded you .
is this a letter ?
I thought you &apos;d be happy .
I found a r@@ are st@@ am@@ p at that store .
I wanted to meet a really mat@@ ure woman .
can you speak Ch@@ in@@ ese well ?
as far as I know , he isn &apos;t la@@ zy .
it will be easy .
it &apos;s his sta@@ g do .
remember that .
E@@ ul@@ er &apos;s i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty really is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
Tom is a c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ se@@ cur@@ ity exper@@ t .
I think Tom is conf@@ used .
they were all surprised to see me there .
take some for later .
I can &apos;t see@@ m to find your last e @-@ ma@@ il , I wonder if you can res@@ end it to me .
she met the man of her drea@@ ms .
there was an ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion .
I can run as fast as Tom .
it &apos;s hard to ad@@ m@@ it to yourself that you are a fa@@ il@@ ure .
I &apos;m kind of slee@@ p@@ y , too .
when I g@@ row up , I want to be just like you .
they tried to swim to sa@@ fe@@ ty .
please ir@@ on the shirt .
what &apos;re you looking for ?
I &apos;m a@@ w@@ are of the dang@@ er .
I think that hel@@ ps .
Tom took early re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment on health gr@@ oun@@ ds .
I d@@ un@@ no if it &apos;s a bu@@ g or what , but this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are doesn &apos;t work right .
it pain@@ s me to dis@@ agree with your opinion .
don &apos;t you have any will po@@ wer ?
sleep is no less necess@@ ary to health than food .
it &apos;s more interest@@ ing to tra@@ vel alone than to go on a gr@@ ou@@ p t@@ our .
do you have enough bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts ?
the happ@@ i@@ est women , like the happ@@ i@@ est na@@ tions , have no hi@@ story .
the company is in the red .
we really can make this happen .
we were very lucky .
he arrived on time in sp@@ ite of the rain .
what on ear@@ th is it ?
he almost p@@ oo@@ ped his pan@@ ts when he saw that sp@@ i@@ der .
are they taking good care of you ?
I think that it &apos;s going to rain soon .
we lost our ele@@ ct@@ ri@@ city because of the stor@@ m .
I often bor@@ row t@@ oo@@ ls from Tom .
we were surprised at his con@@ du@@ ct .
I &apos;m a busy person .
nobody tal@@ ks to Tom anymore .
there is no N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ s .
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I &apos;ve done it before .
Tom is comm@@ itted to ra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying the de@@ c@@ is@@ ions made by Mary .
he has seen better days .
he told me all the de@@ ta@@ ils .
he is cu@@ tting down tre@@ es on a m@@ oun@@ tain .
get out of here ! all of you !
how can you be sure of that ?
Tom du@@ cked Mary &apos;s p@@ unch .
I know what you were doing .
this medi@@ c@@ ine does not have side e@@ ffe@@ c@@ ts .
I don &apos;t think you can be@@ at me .
I am cal@@ ling back my wife .
I almost believe you .
see@@ ing that you &apos;re not surprised , I think you must have known .
I &apos;m a bit ho@@ ar@@ se .
could I do it ?
this book has a lot of pic@@ tu@@ res .
we took an ex@@ am@@ in@@ ation in mat@@ h last week .
Mary hel@@ ped her mother c@@ ook .
Tom didn &apos;t leave Mary .
on his shirt there was a sa@@ u@@ ce st@@ ain .
th@@ ough I speak with the ton@@ gu@@ es of men and of ang@@ el@@ s , and have not mer@@ cy , I am become as s@@ oun@@ ding br@@ ass , or a t@@ in@@ k@@ ling c@@ y@@ mb@@ al .
he told me about it in pri@@ v@@ ate .
the cats are safe .
do you want to go in ?
that &apos;s much more important .
the@@ ory and pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce do not necess@@ ar@@ ily go together .
he is a fam@@ ous ar@@ ti@@ st .
I called you .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n is the tal@@ ler of the two .
when did you get there ?
I &apos;m very fortun@@ ate .
does this ring a b@@ ell ?
I am looking for@@ ward to your letter .
we must try to pro@@ te@@ ct the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
you think I &apos;m s@@ car@@ ed , don &apos;t you ?
he clos@@ ed his eyes .
at home everything is early , both tal@@ ent and b@@ al@@ d@@ ness .
I have no rea@@ l choice .
it made me think .
H@@ i@@ k@@ ers need to car@@ ry a comp@@ ass with them to find their way through the w@@ oo@@ ds .
take a tis@@ su@@ e , your n@@ ose is run@@ ning .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to Christ@@ mas .
I hate black hu@@ m@@ or .
before talking with Tom , Mary ar@@ med her@@ self with cour@@ age .
I told her to come visit us .
a boy r@@ an up to me .
it looks nice with your tr@@ ous@@ ers .
yesterday I was cle@@ ver and tried to change the world , and today I have become w@@ ise and started with myself .
you &apos;re not very f@@ un@@ ny .
Tom was very angry with me .
don &apos;t you see who &apos;s fol@@ low@@ ing us ?
with an@@ im@@ als I wish to live my life ; they &apos;re such great comp@@ an@@ ions !
how did they find out ?
I haven &apos;t seen any of his pic@@ tu@@ res .
I had har@@ dly wal@@ ked a m@@ ile when it beg@@ an to th@@ under .
there &apos;s a ru@@ m@@ or going around that she got a new job .
don &apos;t talk to me like this .
let me stop here .
I thought you &apos;d be tal@@ ler .
aren &apos;t you too young to smo@@ ke ?
can you tell me the time , please ?
this is taking way too long .
you &apos;re such an i@@ di@@ o@@ t !
I ate too much last night .
Tom has v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ered to help us .
I am afraid of off@@ en@@ ding you .
in the mi@@ dd@@ le of difficul@@ ty lies op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity .
I would also like to get into the W@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ A@@ p@@ p G@@ r@@ ou@@ p .
you have all these books !
can you answer this ri@@ dd@@ le ?
she &apos;s a really nice person .
it &apos;s your money .
she ha@@ tes par@@ ties .
that &apos;s something I like .
a fam@@ ous ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect buil@@ t this house .
I didn &apos;t have the heart to tell you .
he &apos;s run@@ ning for C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss .
Sami spo@@ ke little A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic .
there wasn &apos;t a s@@ ou@@ l .
please be@@ ar in mind what I said .
I want you to be qui@@ et .
I believe in you .
is this the boy you were talking about ?
the no@@ vel has so@@ ld almost 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 co@@ pi@@ es .
it was a comple@@ te c@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ fu@@ ck .
do you really think that ?
does she have any al@@ l@@ er@@ gi@@ es ?
she &apos;s an her@@ o@@ in ad@@ di@@ ct .
I as@@ sure you that an er@@ r@@ or like this will never happen again .
we &apos;re going to need some help .
I gave my word .
a m@@ ot@@ el is like a hotel only much sm@@ al@@ ler and is used m@@ os@@ tly by people tra@@ vel@@ ing by au@@ to@@ mo@@ b@@ ile .

do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
you won &apos;t stay , will you ?
she gave me h@@ ell .
I didn &apos;t k@@ ill anyone .
she was very sa@@ tis@@ fied .
how much did the tic@@ ke@@ ts cost you ?

do you believe in a go@@ d ?
she thinks of nothing but making money .
may I sh@@ ar@@ p@@ en my pen@@ ci@@ l ?
it seems that M@@ r@@ . T@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ a has ta@@ ken his ex@@ am .

she advis@@ ed him to keep his promis@@ es .
I war@@ ned you ; now do as you wish .
it ra@@ ins so@@ f@@ tly on the town .
that might happen on M@@ on@@ day .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;m interested in what he does .

F@@ ill out the quest@@ i@@ on@@ na@@ i@@ re .

Tom and Mary lived in the same town .
good night !
you should have told him .
I hope the e@@ con@@ o@@ my pic@@ ks up soon .

I &apos;ve heard of you .
I didn &apos;t see him again after that .
was that what Tom said ?
he called out for help .
I work in the fi@@ el@@ d of art .
you should think of this as an op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity .
&quot; may I speak to Mr N@@ a@@ k@@ aga@@ w@@ a ? &quot; &quot; speaking . &quot;
there are only a few mista@@ kes , or per@@ h@@ ap@@ s n@@ one at all .

how did I let this happen ?
pati@@ ence is sometimes the most e@@ ffe@@ ctive we@@ ap@@ on .

my father got home late last night .
he &apos;s a bit na@@ i@@ ve .
you can &apos;t hurt my feel@@ ings .
we miss Tom terri@@ b@@ ly .
about four th@@ ous@@ and sol@@ di@@ ers were killed .

Tom p@@ us@@ hed back his c@@ hair and got up .
there are more important things in life .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
I &apos;m sure I can find something for you to do .
to believe himself in the port of N@@ ap@@ les , all that was nee@@ ded was to see the g@@ list@@ ening of k@@ ni@@ ves .
all I want is money .
we c@@ li@@ mb@@ ed right up to the top .
how long have you known M@@ is@@ s S@@ m@@ ith ?
the gu@@ est@@ s are all g@@ one .
an i@@ dea@@ l p@@ il@@ low is a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able from a ma@@ il @-@ order house .
the right is on my side .
boys are more ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive than girls .
nothing ever makes him angry .
she said that she would fol@@ low him no matter where he went .
you don &apos;t have the right .
my b@@ oss turned down his pro@@ pos@@ al .
I &apos;ve learned a lot about mo@@ der@@ n au@@ th@@ ors .
Tom married a much you@@ ng@@ er woman .
Tom was w@@ ear@@ ing his pa@@ j@@ a@@ mas when he opened the door .

the v@@ ot@@ e is un@@ an@@ im@@ ous .
she advis@@ ed him not to dri@@ ve too fast , but he wouldn &apos;t listen to her .
money doesn &apos;t g@@ row on tre@@ es , you know .
I thought it difficult for her to get the ti@@ cket .
M@@ i@@ y@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ k@@ i is not what it used to be .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s grand@@ mother pas@@ sed away after a long ill@@ ness .
stor@@ ies often have happy en@@ d@@ ings .

the dog looks sick .
he who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing .
I really miss you .
I don &apos;t like your sm@@ ile .
it &apos;s not f@@ un@@ ny .
Tom thought that Mary was as@@ le@@ e@@ p .
we &apos;ll make up for the l@@ oss .
the off@@ er is too good to be turned down .
why can &apos;t I play with my friends ?
I study English every day .
I don &apos;t trans@@ late for free .
the th@@ i@@ e@@ f got away with the money .
just looking at her , you can tell that she likes you .
S@@ an@@ t@@ a C@@ la@@ us , I want to re@@ cei@@ ve a girlfriend for Christ@@ mas .
Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t spend so much .
I miss you .
parents need to set the ru@@ les around the house .
I didn &apos;t want you to get inv@@ ol@@ ved .

I don &apos;t want to talk about this now .

by the way , where were you ?
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
I knew this mo@@ ment would come .
Tom decided to go home early .
world W@@ ar I bro@@ ke out in 1@@ 9@@ 1@@ 4 .
who can tell me how a light bu@@ l@@ b works ?
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .
wasn &apos;t that enough for you ?
I &apos;m going to ask you something .
Tom knows very little about sp@@ or@@ ts .

I don &apos;t have time to say this tw@@ ice , so listen car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity killed the cat .
are you saying I sm@@ ell bad ?

I love this place .

why have you for@@ go@@ tt@@ en the p@@ ot@@ ato@@ es and not the beer ?
did you tell Tom he could bor@@ row your car ?

Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends .
he probably has a girlfriend already .
there are a lot of b@@ ri@@ d@@ g@@ es in this city .
is there any@@ where you want to go ?
I got busy .
Tom is a go@@ l@@ d@@ sm@@ ith .
&quot; don &apos;t c@@ ry , &quot; she said .

you should have been more careful .
you will get the wor@@ st be@@ ating of your life .
I &apos;m lon@@ ely without you .
we are ho@@ ping to visit S@@ pain this summer .
Tom hasn &apos;t said a word .
he used to read a lot .
is that underst@@ ood ?
is it all right to eat out tonight ?
my parents sent me to f@@ at ca@@ m@@ p when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
she seems to be interested in him .
how did you find me ?
the girl pa@@ used and sm@@ iled ; the young man pa@@ used and si@@ gh@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
they all came by bi@@ ke .
you should not sleep .
living without ill@@ us@@ ions is the secre@@ t to happ@@ iness .
it was just as I thought .
take this to your mother .
don &apos;t forget to s@@ end that letter .
why are you so interested ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a de@@ cent car .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
to tell the truth , I completely forgot .
have you g@@ one crazy ?
she has never fal@@ le@@ n in love .
I was at the party .
this t@@ y@@ pe of person is bor@@ ing .
B@@ ye , S@@ a@@ yo@@ k@@ o !
he lost a fortun@@ e in the sto@@ ck mar@@ ket .
se@@ ction 9 of the E@@ n@@ dang@@ ered S@@ pe@@ ci@@ es A@@ ct makes it il@@ le@@ g@@ al to take an en@@ dang@@ ered spe@@ ci@@ es of fish or w@@ il@@ d@@ life .

what do you want to see while you &apos;re here ?
I wonder if anything happened to him .
I love all of you .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
it is pre@@ mat@@ ure to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s it now .
no one knows her .
we often hear you sing .
he diff@@ ers from his brother .
when are you going home ?
they wa@@ ved fl@@ ag@@ s to w@@ el@@ come the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess .
he was be@@ coming a fam@@ ous sin@@ ger .
I qu@@ it smoking .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
we were att@@ ac@@ ked by s@@ war@@ ms of be@@ es .
f@@ ear is a bad advis@@ er .
it &apos;s a very small pri@@ ce for such an important v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sha@@ med in the v@@ ill@@ age by his che@@ ating wife .
Tom isn &apos;t a min@@ or .
Tom took out a ba@@ g of mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ ws .
you know this isn &apos;t the way we should be doing this .
I gave the house to you .
what do you re@@ gre@@ t most ?
don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t war@@ n you .
the little girl , de@@ e@@ p@@ ly mo@@ ved by the old man &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful story , bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
it de@@ p@@ ends on how much money you have .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .
he likes taking wal@@ ks .
what are your con@@ cl@@ us@@ ions ?
put the p@@ li@@ ers in the t@@ ool bo@@ x .
the r@@ ou@@ te was b@@ lo@@ cked by a t@@ ree .
I often pla@@ yed tru@@ ant .
Tom has col@@ le@@ cted a great many bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies .
now sha@@ ke hands and make up .
the S@@ u@@ n sm@@ iled through the window every morning .
I was in way over my head .
I have no par@@ ti@@ cu@@ lar tal@@ ent .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
guess what I found on the be@@ ach .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot .
the girl who lives next door is very pretty .
we should have told him the truth .
they are out sho@@ p@@ ping .
Tom is de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to lose we@@ ight .
they are ac@@ t@@ ors .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese .
some people say that the the@@ ory of e@@ vo@@ lution is &quot; only &quot; a the@@ ory but a sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c the@@ ory is something that has been pro@@ ven to be true .
there &apos;s no so@@ a@@ p .
I felt de@@ pres@@ sed .
they sp@@ ent the af@@ ternoon around the p@@ ool .
I couldn &apos;t find it any@@ where .
can you show me ?
we &apos;ll take part in the mar@@ a@@ th@@ on .
what &apos;s your di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is ?
some@@ day the U@@ S@@ A will ele@@ ct a woman pre@@ si@@ dent , and it won &apos;t be pretty .
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
this an@@ i@@ mal is mine .
it &apos;s A@@ pri@@ l first .
he will soon get used to the c@@ li@@ m@@ ate here .
what kind of person am I ?
I ad@@ mi@@ re your ig@@ nor@@ ance .
if I s@@ cre@@ w up , what &apos;s the wor@@ st that can happen ?
what you did to Tom was c@@ ru@@ el .
that ro@@ ck band gi@@ ves me a hea@@ d@@ ac@@ he .
I can &apos;t forget about that stu@@ p@@ id movie .
who gi@@ ves a fu@@ ck ?
no one could den@@ y this .

you &apos;re lucky to have such a good job .
I agree with some of your opin@@ ions .
I was already married at your age .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I have no ob@@ je@@ ction .
I just got ten@@ ure .
do you have any c@@ as@@ h ?

I &apos;d tell you all you want and more , if the s@@ oun@@ ds I made could be what you hear .
take any two car@@ ds you like .
over 3@@ 00 people were ar@@ re@@ sted .

what can you teac@@ h me ?
that won &apos;t change anything .
we &apos;re done .
you need to re@@ de@@ cor@@ ate your room .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
I know you feel bad .
I have stayed in K@@ yo@@ to for three days .

a gu@@ i@@ de con@@ du@@ cted the vis@@ it@@ ors r@@ ound the mus@@ e@@ um .
this problem is difficult to sol@@ ve .
how do you know that you don &apos;t need a bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard ?
I couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to look at her .
the bo@@ m@@ b will ex@@ p@@ lo@@ de in 1@@ 0 secon@@ ds .
that is his house .
smoking har@@ ms your health .
where are you going ?
your sister called .
they saw us as they were getting off the train .
he wants to s@@ qu@@ ish the bu@@ g .
I understand your feel@@ ings .
I didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
now and then your sister as@@ ks our si@@ st@@ ers to teac@@ h her something .
I don &apos;t want my son to be like you .
R@@ e@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion hel@@ ps you remember something .
when will your new no@@ vel come out ?
why did you agree to help them ?
why did you do that ?
she ex@@ pla@@ ined to him why she didn &apos;t like his parents .

I hate go@@ at che@@ ese .

what cra@@ p ! your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant comm@@ ents aren &apos;t just us@@ e@@ less but also a pain in the ar@@ se .
I am thinking about bu@@ ying a new par@@ as@@ o@@ l .
I like list@@ ening to the go@@ l@@ d@@ fin@@ ch@@ es sing@@ ing .
how about for tomorrow ?
she can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an .
I fol@@ lowed the reci@@ pe .
things are about to change .
stop d@@ el@@ u@@ ding yourself .
we like nobody and nobody likes us .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
be pre@@ par@@ ed .
I think that they will fol@@ low us .
I appreciate your sup@@ port .
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced himself .
I am just war@@ m@@ ing up now .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
does it bo@@ ther you if I smo@@ ke ?
she has a pian@@ o les@@ son once a week .
it go@@ es without saying that smoking is bad for the health .
the train was d@@ el@@ a@@ yed because of heav@@ y s@@ no@@ w@@ f@@ all .
I hate them all .
it is very fine today .
I o@@ we you my life .
Mary is a better swi@@ mmer than J@@ an@@ e .
are you really going to let Tom do that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t like your idea .
Tom must learn French .
Mary is thir@@ st@@ y .
no @-@ one inv@@ ited her .
I know something you don &apos;t .
are we ma@@ d s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls ?
the st@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty of Ch@@ in@@ ese e@@ con@@ o@@ my is sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally over@@ est@@ im@@ ated .
I felt bad about what I did .
do you get it ?
may I ask you some more questions ?
this mo@@ ve@@ ment from r@@ ur@@ al to ur@@ b@@ an ar@@ ea@@ s has been going on for over two hun@@ dr@@ ed years .
s@@ end it to me .
you can &apos;t smo@@ ke here .
do you have a b@@ lo@@ g ?
I met her late in the even@@ ing .
when is the breakfast ser@@ ved ?
I &apos;m here with a friend .
do you want me to believe that ?
Tom was afraid of fa@@ il@@ ure .
I me@@ s@@ sed up .
O@@ w !
she would have been very pr@@ ou@@ d of you .
I &apos;ve been wal@@ king on c@@ ru@@ t@@ ch@@ es ever since I bro@@ ke my foo@@ t .
this idea has never en@@ ter@@ ed my head before .
I don &apos;t understand any of this .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
the R@@ h@@ ine run@@ s between France and Ger@@ many .
they went to the pu@@ b@@ lic swimming p@@ ool .
I said that this was a meeting room , not a be@@ d@@ room !
the Ear@@ th is a big ball .
it &apos;s my turn to tell you a secre@@ t .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
you &apos;re living in the past .
where exactly did you go ?
why can &apos;t I see you ?
I kind of li@@ ked them .
I &apos;m glad to have this op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to speak to you .
nothing see@@ med out of the or@@ din@@ ary .
did you ac@@ tually see it ?
I must buy a new win@@ ter coat .
I know you &apos;re just trying to help , and I appreciate that .
the re@@ vo@@ lution won &apos;t be so@@ b@@ er .
must I take this medi@@ c@@ ine ?
before cr@@ os@@ sing any st@@ re@@ et , look first left , then right , and left again .
that &apos;s strang@@ e . I could have s@@ wor@@ n that I &apos;d lo@@ cked this door .
I &apos;ve been looking for you every@@ where .
by all me@@ ans .
we miss you very much .
Sami was we@@ al@@ thy in land .
a team of par@@ a@@ medi@@ c@@ s is stan@@ ding by .
they hon@@ or@@ ed me on my bir@@ thday .
just think about how you &apos;d feel in a si@@ mil@@ ar sit@@ uation .
do you want money ?
Tom stu@@ t@@ ters .
Tom ca@@ used quite a lot of trouble .
it &apos;s computer @-@ gen@@ er@@ ated .
he eat@@ s nothing more than fr@@ u@@ it .
how many people can f@@ it in your car ?
s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls eat ac@@ or@@ n@@ s .
it &apos;s he@@ c@@ tic at my place . how about we go back to your place and watch the game there ?
I over@@ sle@@ pt because I stayed up late .
I like b@@ an@@ an@@ as more than app@@ les .
he did a pretty good job .
then the do@@ ll &apos;s eyes beg@@ an to sh@@ ine like two star@@ s and it became ali@@ ve .
the de@@ te@@ ctive took down his te@@ st@@ i@@ mon@@ y on the spo@@ t .
I think you &apos;re dr@@ unk .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we su@@ ff@@ er , together ex@@ ist and fore@@ ver will re@@ cre@@ ate each other .
it &apos;s an ou@@ tr@@ age .
we all became sol@@ di@@ ers .
I hate these sho@@ es .
Tom is too young to go to school .
I don &apos;t like pa@@ ying ta@@ x@@ es .
Tom ge@@ ts up at six every morning .
you &apos;re no fun anymore .
she got him into trouble .
&quot; stop beg@@ g@@ ing for a coo@@ ki@@ e , T@@ i@@ m , &quot; his mu@@ m said , &quot; R@@ e@@ member , &apos; Ch@@ il@@ dren who ask get sk@@ i@@ pped . &apos; &quot;
Tom and Mary are a mus@@ ic@@ al du@@ o .
I don &apos;t understand why people believe in gh@@ os@@ ts .
sen@@ ten@@ ces can teac@@ h us a lot . and a lot more than just words .
I succ@@ ee@@ ded in getting what I wanted .
that &apos;s what I hope .
it mat@@ ters .
what kind of t@@ at@@ too do you want ?
he den@@ i@@ ed the ru@@ m@@ or .
I have six m@@ ou@@ ths to fe@@ ed .
don &apos;t eat like a pi@@ g .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
get that thing off of me .
there &apos;s no place like home .
Tom is eas@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mis@@ underst@@ an@@ ding .
I sup@@ p@@ ose you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that bro@@ ke the window yesterday .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thinking of coming back to the S@@ t@@ ates ?
the poor old man was re@@ du@@ ced to just a s@@ ke@@ le@@ ton .
where &apos;s my phone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .
the baby ta@@ kes after his mother .
I was te@@ mp@@ ted to call in sick .
the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ life is better in N@@ ew Y@@ or@@ k .
you have be@@ tra@@ yed us .
Tom made Mary happy .
I would also take a lot of money .
it &apos;s the ul@@ tim@@ ate t@@ est .
J@@ u@@ gg@@ ling is ac@@ tually a lot eas@@ i@@ er than it looks .
Mary knows nothing of se@@ w@@ ing or k@@ n@@ it@@ ting .
my last name is J@@ on@@ es .
that &apos;s sor@@ t of nice .
he dri@@ ves a tru@@ ck .
everyone was s@@ c@@ rea@@ m@@ ing .
give me a ha@@ mmer .
bir@@ ds f@@ ly long dist@@ an@@ ces .
busy as usu@@ al ?
they kno@@ cked on the door and said they had come to ar@@ re@@ st him .
I wa@@ ited for an h@@ our , but he didn &apos;t app@@ ear .
I got up while it was still dark .
what does this pain@@ ting re@@ pres@@ ent ?
the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ lo@@ g@@ ist asked me a whole b@@ at@@ ter@@ y of questions .
she left the hospital an h@@ our ago .
I wa@@ ited for him all day long .
this was his one and only hope .
I st@@ op@@ ped at the store and got some milk on my way back .
be nice .
he is just mus@@ ic@@ ally gi@@ f@@ ted . he ma@@ st@@ ered the gu@@ it@@ ar in one year at the age of 1@@ 5 .
the se@@ a is very gre@@ en .
do you think something like that will re@@ pe@@ at it@@ self ?
guess whose bir@@ thday it is today .
do you love me ?
some of these are mine .
there is a school down the m@@ oun@@ tain .
promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
who left this me@@ ss in the to@@ i@@ let ?
any c@@ lu@@ es ?
he became world @-@ fam@@ ous for his dis@@ co@@ very .
you need to sa@@ ve the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess .
who won today ?
exc@@ use me . can you di@@ re@@ ct me to the ne@@ ar@@ est sub@@ way station ?
I list@@ ened to the ra@@ di@@ o while I wor@@ ked .
this is your chance .
leave me alone .
I met B@@ o@@ b and Mary while I was waiting for K@@ ate .
Tom es@@ cap@@ ed .
can you do a hand@@ st@@ and ?
who does your de@@ cor@@ ating ?
that s@@ oun@@ ds like a great idea .
I was about to go out when the phone r@@ an@@ g .
after what has happened , I d@@ are not see her again .
you &apos;re very busy .
you are to see a doctor at once .
ad@@ d the ma@@ yo@@ n@@ na@@ ise .
Ger@@ many was once al@@ li@@ ed with I@@ tal@@ y .
do your parents know about this ?
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ll miss her a lot .
I was too tired to care for anything but bed .
he won a go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you .
both Tom and Mary smo@@ ke .
it &apos;s ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
the man is e@@ ating b@@ read .
he is of a hu@@ mor@@ ous turn of mind .
A@@ a@@ w@@ w ! he &apos;s so cu@@ te .
K@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ st@@ an is one of the de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es in C@@ en@@ tr@@ al A@@ si@@ a .
I can &apos;t thank you enough for all your kin@@ d@@ ness .
he kept his sense of hu@@ m@@ or until the day he died .
I need more p@@ aper for my d@@ ra@@ win@@ gs .
Tom has two le@@ gs .
I will be working on my re@@ port all day tomorrow .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
for the time being , I in@@ t@@ end to stay at a hotel .
you should go and have your hair cut .
as usu@@ al , he was the last to arri@@ ve at the the@@ at@@ er .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ t@@ or .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll arri@@ ve next week .
as he couldn &apos;t en@@ du@@ re , he took to his he@@ el@@ s .
the j@@ ur@@ y didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone else going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ thers or si@@ st@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too str@@ ong for me . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I am sorry . per@@ h@@ ap@@ s ad@@ d a little milk . &quot;
he made a sp@@ ee@@ ch in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom hasn &apos;t reali@@ zed his mistake yet .
if you go to that su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket , you can buy most things you use in your da@@ ily life .
let &apos;s re@@ st a little .
there was ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tely nothing you could do about it .
do you like h@@ or@@ r@@ or movi@@ es ?
whose turn is it ?
do you have any advice for me ?
J@@ an@@ e is not as t@@ all as Mary .
where does J@@ o@@ h@@ n live ?
I looked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the road .
I think that &apos;s the best answer .
what foo@@ ds , if any , do you a@@ vo@@ id e@@ ating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that ar@@ ti@@ cle makes fun of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ar@@ i@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zed the man in the pho@@ to .
we should just enjo@@ y this and not worry about how much it c@@ os@@ ts .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right behind you .
the re@@ sul@@ t was rather dis@@ appoin@@ ting .
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
by 2@@ 0@@ 3@@ 0 tw@@ en@@ ty @-@ one per@@ cent of its popu@@ la@@ tion will be over si@@ x@@ ty @-@ five .
where did you hear that story ?
I learned how to use a ha@@ mmer from my d@@ ad .
we lost on that job .
he has a pi@@ thy re@@ mar@@ k for every o@@ cc@@ as@@ ion .
she wor@@ e heart @-@ sh@@ ap@@ ed ear@@ r@@ ings .
when I run , I get s@@ we@@ at@@ y .
left @-@ w@@ ing comm@@ un@@ is@@ m is an in@@ f@@ an@@ ti@@ le di@@ sor@@ der .
I haven &apos;t yet done what you &apos;ve asked me to do .
I wash my app@@ le .
he is an ac@@ ro@@ b@@ at .
your brother is sick .
Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
he did what he promis@@ ed to do for me .
she tre@@ ated him like a king .
Tom is not cr@@ ying .
tell us how to sol@@ ve the problem .
you didn &apos;t make it clear .
she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
be mer@@ ci@@ ful .
I spo@@ ke to him yesterday .
she &apos;s no sa@@ int .
I drea@@ med I had been ab@@ du@@ cted by ali@@ ens .
I &apos;m in way over my head .
Tom will ref@@ use to do that .
she p@@ us@@ hed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t expe@@ ct you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ e@@ f enough ro@@ pe and he &apos;ll han@@ g himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ mp@@ et at school .
he arrived at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ n@@ ic together .
you &apos;re cre@@ e@@ p@@ y .
Tom often makes the same mista@@ kes .
I hear that Mary is very pretty .
I don &apos;t get it .
I went there times without number .
the company man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tu@@ res a v@@ ar@@ i@@ e@@ ty of p@@ aper g@@ oo@@ ds .
you didn &apos;t have to fin@@ ish early .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .

I would like to be able to jo@@ in the W@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ A@@ p@@ p G@@ r@@ ou@@ p .
my doctor advis@@ ed me to give up smoking .
I know you &apos;re still in love with me .
I can &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ re out anything .

I &apos;ve been trying to get your at@@ tention .
who was respon@@ sible ?
I am at the b@@ ank .
you see@@ m happy .
he was a go@@ d to his people .
is this your daughter ?
I need more infor@@ mation on this matter .
Tom said he wanted those .

I &apos;m an@@ x@@ ious about the future .
do you like tri@@ ps ?
Tom o@@ w@@ es Mary a lot of money .
how did you sleep last night ?
are you leaving tomorrow ?
Tom c@@ la@@ im@@ s to have p@@ sy@@ c@@ hi@@ c po@@ w@@ ers .
he must be a good boy .
if you &apos;re not careful , you might have an accident .
can you des@@ cri@@ be the sit@@ uation you were in ?
are those people ter@@ r@@ or@@ i@@ sts ?
I f@@ ed the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s to my dog .
what a to@@ ta@@ l i@@ di@@ o@@ t !
he lived to be se@@ ven@@ ty years old .
you are free tomorrow .
I was off du@@ ty at the time .
the man never told the poli@@ ce what his de@@ st@@ in@@ ation was .
these are my daugh@@ ters .
she sle@@ pt off her han@@ go@@ ver .
I &apos;m not used to getting up early .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m not getting fir@@ ed .
I can look into this for you .

don &apos;t read this sen@@ t@@ ence .
please don &apos;t go home .
win@@ ter is s@@ now time .

you should keep your promis@@ es .
I didn &apos;t say it happened here .
so ? feeling ref@@ re@@ sh@@ ed , the morning after g@@ ra@@ du@@ ating from vir@@ g@@ in@@ ity ?
how do you plan on pa@@ ying for that ?
we &apos;re through .
he was too young to go to school .
which foo@@ ds are rich in cal@@ or@@ ies and which aren &apos;t ?
wait a se@@ c .
the si@@ st@@ ers are both bl@@ on@@ d@@ es .
I &apos;ve won .
she was very ne@@ ar@@ ly run over by a tru@@ ck .
we &apos;ve been working on this problem all wee@@ k@@ end .
you make it look easy .
they &apos;re bro@@ thers .
I know Tom is a me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic .
my Ch@@ in@@ ese is terri@@ ble .
I need someone who I can talk to .
the boy &apos;s ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sion is making problems .
I don &apos;t go in for that sor@@ t of thing .
the b@@ oss doesn &apos;t know it yet .
they wal@@ ked together .
I bought her a new car .
they un@@ wr@@ app@@ ed their s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ es .
even@@ tually it was possible to find a really sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ ory so@@ lution .
he didn &apos;t look happy .
I &apos;ll ri@@ de sho@@ t@@ gu@@ n .
I have a bo@@ y@@ friend who lo@@ ves me .
health is ab@@ o@@ ve we@@ al@@ th ; the lat@@ ter gi@@ ves less fortun@@ e than the for@@ m@@ er .
your re@@ qu@@ est has been den@@ i@@ ed because you have no v@@ al@@ id resi@@ d@@ enti@@ al ad@@ dress .
I did not lose my mind , I so@@ ld it on e@@ B@@ ay .
he is always a ste@@ p or two a@@ head of the times .
I can &apos;t see it .
here &apos;s the ad@@ dress .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .
the two car@@ s col@@ li@@ ded at the inter@@ se@@ ction .
C@@ o@@ mp@@ as@@ sion is the b@@ as@@ is of all mor@@ al@@ ity .

Dan had no me@@ mor@@ y of what he had done .
the C@@ a@@ th@@ ar@@ es in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n France were called A@@ l@@ bi@@ gen@@ si@@ ans .
Sami was very in@@ tel@@ lig@@ ent .

Sami is tal@@ ler than me .
I@@ s@@ ra@@ el is a beautiful country .
she had her dress made .
V@@ o@@ we@@ l har@@ mon@@ y is important in the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian language .

I know where you hi@@ de your di@@ ary .
Tom said he had more important things to do .
B@@ re@@ and@@ รก@@ n is a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
what &apos;s Tom good at ?
everything was difficult .
no one rea@@ ds my b@@ lo@@ g .
by the time he fin@@ ds out , it will be too late .
how did you lose it ?
she called him every other day .
he was late because of the s@@ now .
she said she had been happy .
how long will this go on ?
I think we &apos;re even .
I gave it my best shot .
my doctor thinks it &apos;s can@@ cer@@ ous but told me to feel free to get a secon@@ d opinion .
the cu@@ sto@@ ms office is at the bor@@ der .
we took tur@@ n@@ s with the dri@@ ving .
what happened last night ?
who would better his st@@ ate should look to his f@@ oun@@ da@@ tions .
the con@@ tr@@ act was en@@ ded .

Tom ri@@ s@@ ked his life for us .
I &apos;m not sure what to say .
it &apos;s the same here .
the cost of buil@@ ding the new hospital was consi@@ der@@ ably hi@@ gh@@ er than first est@@ im@@ ated .
I saw him kis@@ sing another girl .
which sk@@ ir@@ t do you like ?
I don &apos;t drink .
don &apos;t you think I know my own h@@ us@@ band ?
in h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght , this was a mistake .
I think Tom did a really nice job .
have you put on s@@ un@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?

are you students ?
I couldn &apos;t li@@ e to you .
how much will this cost ?
what am I up against ?
Sami ref@@ used to get inv@@ ol@@ ved .

don &apos;t d@@ well too much up@@ on the sub@@ ject .
nobody can con@@ tro@@ l us .
I didn &apos;t want to in@@ sul@@ t you .
where is his house ?
he had no friend to help him .
man is never per@@ fe@@ ct , no@@ r con@@ t@@ ent .
we were par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
I can see a clear b@@ lu@@ e sk@@ y and feel so good .
Tom is ol@@ der than me .
I &apos;m ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ ed !

would you come with us ?

if each gen@@ er@@ ation di@@ e and leave gh@@ os@@ ts the world at last will get over@@ c@@ row@@ ded with them .
no one here will be@@ tr@@ ay you .
I was de@@ man@@ ding .

Tom told Mary he had to talk to her .
Japanese women get married at 2@@ 5 on a@@ ver@@ age .
her hair is long and beautiful .
does it matter to you ?
everyone knew .
j@@ ack is b@@ ound to su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed this time .
I &apos;m ready for tomorrow .
do your best and don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ve been fol@@ low@@ ing you .

P@@ au@@ l tal@@ ks a lot .
I had a light lunch .
what have you been thinking about for so long ?
I couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .

my father has a restaurant .
I was terri@@ b@@ ly wor@@ ried .
Tom wa@@ ited for Mary for three hours .

why are they leaving ?
one of the hun@@ ters was shot and had to be ta@@ ken to hospital , where he is now making a sp@@ ee@@ dy re@@ co@@ very .

Tom has decided to put off his de@@ par@@ ture .

while you &apos;re young , you should read a lot .
Tom isn &apos;t dea@@ d .

anybody can par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
nobody likes him .
she &apos;d like him to leave right away .

why are you looking at me ?
I &apos;m so sick of this .
Japan is here !
he turned around .
I still don &apos;t know what that is .

I knew I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom won &apos;t visit Boston .

Tom knows Mary is hi@@ ding something .
to tell the truth , I don &apos;t agree with you .
E@@ sp@@ er@@ an@@ to b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to everyone . un@@ fortun@@ ately , not everybody knows that .

there are some good mar@@ ri@@ ages , but there are no de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous on@@ es .
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
the teacher asked me a difficult question .
I already told you he isn &apos;t here .

I may have to work part time .

Tom is l@@ ying in bed with a cold .

I heard that she came here .

T@@ r@@ an@@ g , when are you going to up@@ d@@ ate Tatoeba ?
you &apos;re a cu@@ te girl .
I knew we were going to get married the mo@@ ment I met you .
father , for@@ give them ; for they know not what they do .
he had no idea what to expe@@ ct .
I &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .
what a great idea !
come back tomorrow .
we have nothing in comm@@ on .
the bu@@ ds beg@@ an to bur@@ st .
I have to go up@@ sta@@ irs .
Dan shot M@@ at@@ t in self @-@ de@@ f@@ ence .
forget it !
Tom was in love with M@@ ar@@ i@@ a , but she didn &apos;t want to know anything about him .
the man died a few hours ago .
I ad@@ mi@@ re Tom &apos;s per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
she has a thing for ol@@ der men .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
the T@@ ick@@ D@@ is@@ play f@@ un@@ ction has to be called every fra@@ me in order to play the an@@ i@@ mation .
the se@@ ar@@ ch for ali@@ en life is one of hu@@ man@@ kind &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ al c@@ hal@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es .
the past is no longer and the future is not yet .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ve off@@ en@@ ded you .
Mary thinks that O@@ li@@ ver is sp@@ en@@ ding too much time playing vi@@ de@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ es .
I &apos;ve done that coun@@ t@@ less times .
you gu@@ ys are a@@ we@@ some .
we know that you &apos;re sick .
I &apos;d take it if I were you .
did you go to the restaurant yesterday ?
she found him stan@@ ding near the en@@ tr@@ ance .
put the car into the gar@@ age .
I expe@@ ct you to be pun@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
what was the first concer@@ t you went to ?
has Tom been fir@@ ed ?
he mo@@ ves qu@@ ick@@ ly .
the baby fell as@@ le@@ e@@ p in the cra@@ d@@ le .
we looked around the pro@@ per@@ ty .
I can ho@@ ld my b@@ re@@ ath for a long time .
that &apos;s another matter .
we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
this is something I must face alone .
what do I me@@ an to you ?
I su@@ gg@@ est you coo@@ per@@ ate .
we were medi@@ o@@ c@@ re .
me@@ as@@ ure tw@@ ice , cut once .
I didn &apos;t take the time to do it pro@@ per@@ ly .
that &apos;s a really great idea .
time is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than anything else .
where are they swimming ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m talking to you about this .
M@@ e@@ te@@ or@@ olo@@ gi@@ sts are people who know a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t about ge@@ op@@ h@@ y@@ sic@@ s , th@@ er@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s and c@@ li@@ mat@@ olo@@ gy , and almost nothing about tomorrow &apos;s weather .
we have to find a way to get that done .
I fol@@ ded the to@@ w@@ el@@ s .
I have low bl@@ ood pres@@ sure .
he sometimes comes to see me .
I told you not to come here .
what are you going to have ?
I was even@@ tually re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
I have to go to bed .
your room number , please .
I found my bicycle g@@ one .
I feel safe here .
we con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated .
make yourself com@@ for@@ table .
this is a happy o@@ cc@@ as@@ ion .
take it as it comes .
do you feel lucky ?
are there any cu@@ te girls in your class ?
it is now that it be@@ comes interest@@ ing .
Tom has decided to have the sur@@ g@@ er@@ y that his doctor re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
E@@ ri@@ c is on our so@@ cc@@ er team .
when ice m@@ el@@ ts , it be@@ comes li@@ qu@@ id .
Tom was ma@@ u@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we s@@ wa@@ m in the se@@ a .
he sle@@ pt until ten o &apos;@@ clock .
the Ear@@ th is just a little is@@ land and we are little is@@ l@@ and@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in per@@ spe@@ ctive for you .
nobody des@@ er@@ ves that .
I want to speak to my la@@ w@@ y@@ er now .
can you tell us how that &apos;ll work ?
I love my y@@ el@@ low s@@ we@@ at@@ er .
you sha@@ ll have a bicycle for your bir@@ thday .
she made it pl@@ ain that she wanted to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
I was a sh@@ y child .
I sup@@ p@@ ose it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the b@@ ill right now .
he is as@@ ha@@ med to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the s@@ w@@ it@@ ch is bro@@ ken .
these clothes are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be wa@@ sh@@ ed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
A@@ l@@ fr@@ ed , K@@ ing of Eng@@ land , was a great s@@ cho@@ lar as well as a great ru@@ ler .
you need to sleep .
&quot; O@@ h ! they &apos;ll find him gu@@ il@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
every@@ day life can get a bit mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous at times .
was V@@ en@@ us , a des@@ er@@ t plan@@ et with th@@ ic@@ k cl@@ ou@@ ds of sul@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id , fore@@ telling the future of Ear@@ th ?
where did you have your su@@ it made ?
I am not cer@@ tain about that .
while he was sick , he lost a lot of we@@ ight .
I &apos;ll br@@ ing wine .
do f@@ er@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ers con@@ tain ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us ?
have you already eat@@ en sup@@ p@@ er ?
the su@@ n is about to ri@@ se .
it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al to par@@ k a car there .
do you know how to read a ma@@ p ?
I thought I had until 2 : 3@@ 0 .
I like mat@@ h least of all .
that has nothing to do with him .
we call him M@@ i@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some sugar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to wear gl@@ asses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay at@@ tention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your see@@ ing him is good for you .
he is a true col@@ os@@ su@@ s .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the so@@ ci@@ e@@ ty in which they live is very different from our own .
she wrote a lot of po@@ e@@ ms .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in R@@ o@@ me .
how did you become inv@@ ol@@ ved in this pro@@ ject ?
e@@ ither you or I must go in his place .
with all his fa@@ ul@@ ts , he is resp@@ e@@ cted by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy !
Tom har@@ dly ever w@@ ears a ti@@ e .
I pain@@ ted a pic@@ ture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great pho@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ c@@ ru@@ b@@ bed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en flo@@ or with a br@@ ush .
those do@@ ors should be clos@@ ed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am inv@@ ited to .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in a year - sp@@ ring , summer , f@@ all , and win@@ ter .
I want to help you get out of this me@@ ss .
Sami was already on the ro@@ l@@ l@@ er@@ co@@ a@@ ster .
get mo@@ ving !
I must be leaving now .
she was appreci@@ ably t@@ an@@ ned after her vac@@ ation .
the w@@ ood was very dark , and she could not help tre@@ mb@@ ling from f@@ ear .
the ge@@ y@@ s@@ er sen@@ ds up a co@@ lu@@ m@@ n of hot water every two hours .
the e@@ g@@ gs are still hot .
an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke of mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de 5 sh@@ ook T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o .
this ri@@ ver run@@ s through my v@@ ill@@ age .
I like h@@ ang@@ ing out here .
I want Tom to take a look at that .
do you think he will like that ?
ju@@ st@@ ice in this country is a bit of a dou@@ ble st@@ and@@ ard : there is the ju@@ st@@ ice of the poor and the ju@@ st@@ ice of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play H@@ o@@ p S@@ ki@@ p A@@ n@@ d J@@ u@@ m@@ p like me , &quot; said the little wh@@ ite r@@ ab@@ bit .
I wonder what all of them have in comm@@ on .
what was the ca@@ use of the ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion ?
I &apos;ll get my ke@@ ys .
let me go !
may I in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself ?
left @-@ hand th@@ rea@@ ds have now become un@@ su@@ al in me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic@@ s but they can still be found on some ob@@ je@@ c@@ ts , such as on bicy@@ c@@ les &apos; pe@@ d@@ als , for in@@ st@@ ance .
the B@@ B@@ C is my fav@@ our@@ ite ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l .
I pa@@ id two hun@@ dr@@ ed do@@ l@@ lar@@ s in ta@@ x@@ es .
con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions , and th@@ an@@ ks for everything !
he ten@@ ds to be ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
we remember .
it is free of char@@ ge .
will he su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed or fa@@ il ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
J@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ing from his app@@ ear@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have pl@@ en@@ ty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m making an appoin@@ t@@ ment for my daughter .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded to his un@@ cle &apos;s fortun@@ e .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a trou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s expen@@ sive to mo@@ der@@ ni@@ ze a city .
what is the name of that bir@@ d ?
you &apos;re inv@@ ited .
I &apos;m talking with R@@ o@@ c@@ รญ@@ o .
let me see .
women often pain@@ t their fin@@ g@@ er@@ na@@ ils .
they &apos;re not a th@@ re@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that gu@@ y &apos;s a friend of mine .
Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a is about tw@@ en@@ ty times lar@@ ger than Japan .
she cut the cake in two .
you hand@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his succ@@ ess .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I sup@@ p@@ ose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to s@@ it on the b@@ en@@ ch over there next to the st@@ re@@ et la@@ m@@ p .
A@@ n@@ t@@ ar@@ es is a red sta@@ r .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in S@@ pain who spea@@ ks five languages .
is today your bir@@ thday ?
let &apos;s go to P@@ au@@ l &apos;s D@@ in@@ er .
you ought to be qui@@ et in a li@@ br@@ ary .
Tom fell as@@ le@@ e@@ p waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only sli@@ gh@@ tly sm@@ al@@ ler than the Ear@@ th and M@@ ar@@ s is bi@@ g@@ ger than half of Ear@@ th .
do you find that wa@@ sh@@ ing m@@ ac@@ h@@ ine easy to use ?
she comm@@ itted a cri@@ me .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .
it is easy to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish good from e@@ vi@@ l .
how is your d@@ ad ?
br@@ ing them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at least three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the thr@@ ush sin@@ gs each s@@ ong tw@@ ice over .
do you know if he is a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able ? I need to know in order to make an appoin@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on pri@@ ce .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Ch@@ in@@ ese .
have you been told the reas@@ ons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch tele@@ vis@@ ion ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ os@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very com@@ for@@ table .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is hon@@ est .
her belie@@ f in God is very fir@@ m .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language ref@@ le@@ c@@ ts da@@ ily experience .
Tom beg@@ an to shi@@ ver vi@@ ol@@ en@@ tly .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he fa@@ iled .
he should get to your house in an h@@ our .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these f@@ os@@ s@@ ils are the &apos; smoking gu@@ n &apos; just before the e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ cy .
how far do we have to go ?
children g@@ row very qu@@ ick@@ ly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ s , being after all a pro@@ du@@ ct of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent of experience , is so ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ably ad@@ ap@@ ted to the ob@@ je@@ c@@ ts of re@@ al@@ ity ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which col@@ or do you pref@@ er , b@@ lu@@ e or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es cer@@ e@@ mon@@ i@@ ously ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h of na@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ m , do@@ ping and com@@ mer@@ ce .
in the v@@ al@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ le@@ ts came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her sk@@ in was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is s@@ mar@@ t .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a cou@@ ple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ e@@ min@@ ine lo@@ gi@@ c is not always lo@@ g@@ ic@@ al .
when we started out , our band could only find small c@@ lu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ties that would hi@@ re us .
you should resp@@ ect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next wee@@ k@@ end .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw L@@ ay@@ la hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they set out for N@@ ew Y@@ or@@ k .
I des@@ p@@ ise them .
my cat sle@@ pt next to me .
for@@ give me .
the flo@@ or is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from Boston .
an an@@ i@@ mal can be much more dang@@ er@@ ous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you dri@@ ve a st@@ ic@@ k shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the ren@@ ta@@ l car near the poli@@ ce station .
where do you want to go for our first les@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ dered why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ k@@ ers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ oun@@ ds to his am@@ bi@@ tion .
P@@ ine@@ app@@ le is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be ali@@ ve .
you can dri@@ ve a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the la@@ ke , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smoking is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds of times .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ed to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ ca@@ tion .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you me@@ an , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how a@@ w@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents f@@ ight .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a strang@@ er .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mista@@ ken as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she lo@@ ved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I ple@@ ad@@ ed not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ p@@ one the meeting .
you aren &apos;t inv@@ ited .
long live the g@@ er@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the pian@@ o .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but rather out of ab@@ sent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to strang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction for be@@ e@@ f .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such n@@ on@@ sense .
I want you to be qui@@ et .
C@@ ot@@ ton ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on S@@ un@@ day .
you gu@@ ys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to c@@ ook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves are possible .
maybe I should also ad@@ d sen@@ ten@@ ces without trans@@ la@@ tions ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to be@@ t on that ?
we made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kis@@ s you the way you want to be kis@@ sed .
stop t@@ wi@@ sting my ar@@ m !
if he sen@@ ds me any le@@ t@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was war@@ ned .
so@@ on@@ er or later , Tom will li@@ k@@ ely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ pla@@ ining ?
we &apos;d like se@@ par@@ ate che@@ c@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cr@@ os@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re war@@ m enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my an@@ c@@ est@@ ors are . our p@@ ap@@ ers got lost d@@ ur@@ ing the F@@ l@@ ood .
s@@ it down and sh@@ u@@ t up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket .
D@@ ro@@ ple@@ ts are fal@@ ling on my l@@ ap@@ top computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be in@@ tel@@ lig@@ ent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a member .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f t@@ os@@ sing is an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c sp@@ ort !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promis@@ es .
I just want to be per@@ fe@@ ct .
I &apos;m glad I inv@@ ited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ ta@@ l chang@@ es .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to Americ@@ a .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in coo@@ king .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ mber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a f@@ ight with me ?
his kin@@ d@@ ness tou@@ ched my heart .
he stu@@ di@@ es bi@@ olo@@ gy very hard .
my un@@ cle is rich .
to be per@@ fe@@ ct she l@@ ac@@ ked just one de@@ fe@@ ct .
I hear him fal@@ ling .
you don &apos;t have to be a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m .
which way is the be@@ ach ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish !
Sami lived very close to the lo@@ ca@@ tion where L@@ ay@@ la &apos;s body was found .
the s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct is a ca@@ u@@ c@@ as@@ ian fe@@ m@@ al@@ e .
he pain@@ ted a dog .
where did you hi@@ de the food ?
I get ch@@ app@@ ed li@@ ps every win@@ ter .
they de@@ cei@@ ved us .
my fe@@ et are cold .
Mary ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted everything without com@@ pla@@ ining .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our es@@ cap@@ e was nothing sh@@ ort of a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I sur@@ vi@@ ved .
this gl@@ ass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ ose .
my dog has can@@ c@@ er .
do you remember the day this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the t@@ est .
can I speak to you a mo@@ ment ?
they st@@ ood on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite sk@@ in care pro@@ du@@ ct ?
you can bor@@ row three books at a time .
I &apos;m in ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tely to@@ ta@@ l ag@@ re@@ e@@ ment .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody nee@@ ds to know this .
f@@ all is late this year .
they &apos;re on good ter@@ ms with their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a ru@@ le .
who are you clos@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re wor@@ se than Tom .
do the Ger@@ m@@ ans have any other concer@@ n@@ s in life ap@@ art from con@@ su@@ mer@@ is@@ m ?
you should not resp@@ ect a man because he is rich .
the c@@ hair c@@ rea@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
he ex@@ pres@@ sed his belie@@ f in her hon@@ est@@ y .
only they the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was cr@@ ying for her mother .
they ru@@ ined it .
they want pe@@ ace .
are we being char@@ g@@ ed with something ?
I really hate da@@ ir@@ y pro@@ du@@ c@@ ts .
I was right on the spo@@ t when it happened .
be pun@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
I am f@@ our@@ te@@ en years old .
you look so p@@ al@@ e .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a medi@@ um @-@ si@@ zed an@@ i@@ mal .
the school ru@@ les re@@ qui@@ re students to wear school uni@@ for@@ ms .
where can I buy books ?
I have two eyes .

I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I ad@@ mi@@ re her ef@@ for@@ ts .
we can &apos;t get close to the en@@ e@@ my .
there are a lot of star@@ s lar@@ ger than our own S@@ u@@ n .
they aren &apos;t du@@ mber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to nor@@ mal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good c@@ ook .
are you watching the pre@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al de@@ b@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .

that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ aga@@ w@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you consi@@ dered me a close friend .
things will only get wor@@ se .
the girl is drin@@ king te@@ a .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your fa@@ ul@@ t .
she met him on the be@@ ach .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name L@@ ay@@ la ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had go@@ tt@@ en no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ p@@ ping off d@@ ur@@ ing the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eat@@ en yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about re@@ li@@ gi@@ on .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I s@@ wor@@ e I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came run@@ ning to me .
Tom is th@@ row@@ ing st@@ on@@ es at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
death before di@@ sh@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ iled my bicycle .
turn around .
this is not necess@@ ary .
we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your sho@@ es . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stu@@ p@@ id .
write S@@ pan@@ ish .
don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not wr@@ iting about you .
your question is not re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to the sub@@ ject .
she came to see me .
this c@@ hair is too small .
how much time do you ac@@ tually spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ ors of per@@ ce@@ p@@ tion were cle@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
beer is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the por@@ ter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ k@@ ers who were un@@ known while ali@@ ve became fam@@ ous after death .
you &apos;re a terri@@ ble person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the sp@@ u@@ r of the mo@@ ment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gen@@ er@@ ally s@@ il@@ ent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat can@@ dy just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some in@@ side infor@@ mation about the company &apos;s pl@@ ans to go pu@@ b@@ lic .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no so@@ on@@ er had he seen it than he turned p@@ al@@ e .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I appreciate the sen@@ ti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
fin@@ ish drin@@ king your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I sle@@ pt for e@@ ight hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ dered .
this is such a wa@@ st@@ e of time .
Tom is always playing vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es .
I have been to the store before .
stop sen@@ ding me flow@@ ers .
please un@@ dress from the wa@@ ist up .
that &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ ster your pro@@ du@@ ct ?
Dan had to deci@@ de wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ heal@@ thy .
there is a tele@@ vis@@ ion in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to cle@@ an the house .
I haven &apos;t used A@@ n@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds du@@ e .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had ga@@ th@@ ered out@@ side the cour@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the ca@@ p off this bot@@ t@@ le .
I re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
A@@ l@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ ten@@ ted .
I was bor@@ ed .
if I were heal@@ thy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something tro@@ pic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which for@@ ms a sin@@ gu@@ lar con@@ tr@@ ast to her c@@ ool and u@@ ne@@ mo@@ tion@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would listen to me .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ vel I can bor@@ row ?
you have chang@@ ed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , cat@@ ch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ l@@ l@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to cat@@ ch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stu@@ p@@ id ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shirt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear con@@ sci@@ ence when it &apos;s not used .
are you ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ar@@ ian ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sor@@ t this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s str@@ ong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ low@@ ing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated a student &apos;s phone because he was t@@ ex@@ ting in class .
J@@ i@@ m hasn &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ hi@@ stor@@ ic men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should han@@ g out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a sp@@ l@@ as@@ h .
I don &apos;t mind l@@ en@@ ding you the money pro@@ vi@@ ded you pay it back with@@ in a month .
A@@ h .@@ .@@ . o@@ k@@ ay , I was young , but what a stu@@ p@@ id mistake !
in f@@ act , I should thank you for this .
I was ar@@ re@@ sted on the spo@@ t .
I &apos;m stud@@ ying art at school .
that never was an is@@ su@@ e .
you should really l@@ ay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your health .
the medi@@ c@@ ine had no e@@ ffe@@ ct .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ ies of tu@@ b@@ es .
Tom is here some@@ where .
Tom st@@ ood very close to Mary .
he re@@ ma@@ ined s@@ il@@ ent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thinks it is .
will they ele@@ ct him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it ra@@ ined , I stayed home .
Tom put a sta@@ r on top of the Christ@@ mas t@@ ree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I wake up at 7 o &apos;@@ clock .
they have a plan .
Tom did a good job .
Tom never said he wanted to go with us .
do you want some sugar in your coffee ?
are you free tomorrow af@@ ternoon ?
we &apos;re under att@@ ack !
it &apos;s very late .
the whole v@@ ill@@ age knows the man well .
are you up for it ?
b@@ ite the bu@@ l@@ let .
I went to bed at tw@@ el@@ ve last night .
the e@@ ffe@@ ct was immedi@@ ate .
Mary has a new lo@@ ver .
what col@@ or is Mary &apos;s s@@ car@@ f ?
may I eat another pi@@ e@@ ce of cake ?
you never get a secon@@ d chance to make a first im@@ pres@@ sion .
he &apos;s al@@ l@@ er@@ gi@@ c to cats .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
Dan is now wanted by the poli@@ ce .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was ra@@ ining heav@@ ily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the l@@ ine was busy .
I have a coat , but I don &apos;t have a hat .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
you are wa@@ sh@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es .
this won &apos;t sol@@ ve anything .
sometimes T@@ on@@ y vis@@ ited his family .
ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al in@@ tel@@ lig@@ ence can now col@@ le@@ ct infor@@ mation from so@@ ci@@ al medi@@ a and the inter@@ ne@@ t to help des@@ ig@@ n@@ ers understand what the pu@@ b@@ lic likes .
I love to tra@@ vel .
Tom has a b@@ right car@@ e@@ er as a medi@@ cal doctor .

ch@@ ic@@ ken po@@ x is a comm@@ on sic@@ k@@ ness in children .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly how long it will take .
H@@ ence , lo@@ a@@ th@@ ed m@@ el@@ an@@ cho@@ ly .
I was bor@@ ed because I had seen the movie before .
I believe that story .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ mother looks heal@@ thy .
they &apos;re all in there .
many years ago fl@@ ying used to be gla@@ mor@@ ous . now it &apos;s just a pain in the ne@@ ck !
I ad@@ mi@@ re your per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation .
he gave her a pe@@ ck on the ch@@ ee@@ k .
our gu@@ est@@ s are in a hurry .
he went to bed .
which one should I use ?
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced Mary to his mother .
in E@@ uro@@ pe , people re@@ g@@ ard pun@@ c@@ tu@@ al@@ ity as a matter of cour@@ se .
get a room already !
most of these are mine .
Tom &apos;s dog has four le@@ gs .
many young people are out of work in that country .
why don &apos;t I have a bo@@ y@@ friend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
we had to make a de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
B@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant !
I think this is be@@ side the point , right now .
this is a dog .
I need to go sho@@ p@@ ping .
language is the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of a na@@ tion &apos;s ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence .
I have finished my ho@@ me@@ work .

I miss you .
I am a cat . I don &apos;t have a name yet .
you can &apos;t have your cake and eat it .

this place is p@@ ac@@ ked !
I really like that gu@@ y .
they speak French in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c .
a black and wh@@ ite dog bit me .
the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens immedi@@ ately pre@@ par@@ ed everything to de@@ f@@ end the city .
I &apos;m going to jo@@ in a de@@ mon@@ st@@ ra@@ tion .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so spe@@ ci@@ al .
Tom is resp@@ e@@ cted by everybody .
this book is much more us@@ eful than that one .
A@@ c@@ hi@@ e@@ ving a nice w@@ el@@ d be@@ ad is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
someone sp@@ i@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still ali@@ ve , he &apos;d be very old by now .
would you tr@@ ust them ?
I wish I could live in a house that nice .
how long have you been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
I &apos;m what the world cal@@ ls an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
where exactly do you live ?
I went to the p@@ ost office .
I &apos;d like to w@@ el@@ come you all ab@@ o@@ ard .
I will let you know in adv@@ ance .
he is mi@@ les away .
what a won@@ der@@ ful morning ! I feel on top of the world .
I can &apos;t help myself .
I was there last night .
they who drea@@ m by day are co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ cap@@ e those who drea@@ m only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the weather is cl@@ ou@@ dy .
how could you not say something ?
in all li@@ ke@@ li@@ h@@ ood , we sha@@ ll be away for a few days .
what ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les do you usu@@ ally g@@ row ?
if I were rich , I &apos;d buy a car .
he bro@@ ke down when he heard the bad news .
I don &apos;t know which bu@@ tt@@ on to p@@ ush .
she is next to them .
he doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I &apos;m well a@@ w@@ are of the ri@@ s@@ k .
I love c@@ ab@@ b@@ age !
stop corre@@ c@@ ting me .
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee .
th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds of people wanted to know the answer .
there are some things that are difficult to trans@@ late .
are they taking care of you ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a new car .
we want nat@@ ur@@ al @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding trans@@ la@@ tions , not word @-@ for @-@ word di@@ re@@ ct trans@@ la@@ tions .
this is how you get re@@ sul@@ ts .
it kept me from reading .
I was sho@@ cked at the sa@@ d news .
I think this is mine .
how come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
girls like to show off their fine clothes .
this is Tom &apos;s thir@@ d trip to Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a .
Mary ir@@ on@@ ed her sk@@ ir@@ t .

I &apos;m playing with my friends .

I can &apos;t go out .
I s@@ wear to God , if one more person here sa@@ ys &quot; gi@@ ant ro@@ bo@@ t , &quot; you &apos;re all as good as dea@@ d .
I think that Tom is still sleeping .
I don &apos;t think I can keep that promise .
you used to smo@@ ke , didn &apos;t you ?
strang@@ e to say , the teacher didn &apos;t s@@ cold me .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
they started all at once .
he went ab@@ o@@ ard the plan@@ e .
everybody is against me .
his be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or did not cor@@ respon@@ d with his words .
he s@@ la@@ mm@@ ed his door sh@@ u@@ t .
I &apos;m living with my un@@ cle this month .

he pla@@ ys the gu@@ it@@ ar .
mine is better than yours .
I &apos;m a@@ wake .
I am not underst@@ an@@ ding what the au@@ th@@ or is trying to say .
I guess I didn &apos;t want to dis@@ appo@@ int you .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
don &apos;t sleep with the windo@@ ws open .

mother often got angry with us .
I was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted .
I ate my s@@ and@@ w@@ ich .
this is a good question .
she laugh@@ ed at me .
don &apos;t open the door for anyone .
I can &apos;t tr@@ ust my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
the gl@@ ass is fu@@ ll of water .
it hur@@ ts terri@@ b@@ ly .
you worry about your we@@ ight too much .
Tom read the letter .
f@@ ear is es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al for sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al .
please give me a sp@@ are bl@@ an@@ ket .
why do I have to sing with Tom ?
Tom and Mary vis@@ ited S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ vi@@ a .
M@@ e@@ d@@ it@@ ation doesn &apos;t cost anything , but it ta@@ kes time .
the news sp@@ read little by little .
we are Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an .
give me a kis@@ s .
he was ig@@ nor@@ ant of the f@@ act .
I get ma@@ d at his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance .

is it really too difficult to turn off your ph@@ on@@ es ?
France , I love you !
you &apos;re free to go .
I want you to come with me .
I stru@@ gg@@ led to get out of the sub@@ way .

a person vi@@ e@@ ws things differ@@ en@@ tly ac@@ cor@@ ding to wh@@ e@@ ther they are rich or poor .
he li@@ ked everything about her .
do you want me to talk to Tom about what &apos;s going to happen ?
I &apos;m thinking of going ab@@ road next year .
I already know how to dance .
could you do me a fav@@ our please ?
I have t@@ oo@@ th@@ ac@@ he .

do you own a computer ?
S@@ u@@ ck@@ ers !
even th@@ ough he has turned tw@@ en@@ ty , he &apos;s still too tim@@ id to ch@@ at with girls .

G@@ il@@ ded re@@ ins do not make for a better h@@ or@@ se .
how heav@@ y you are !
the si@@ ze of the univer@@ se is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able .
how do you read this k@@ an@@ j@@ i ?
our t@@ ask has been easy so far , but it will be difficult from now on .
she will make a good wife .
I could have pre@@ ven@@ ted this .
tra@@ vel@@ ing was much more difficult in those days .
this is what I bought in S@@ pain .
I &apos;m very interested in the e@@ vo@@ lution of the din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s .
Tom &apos;s coo@@ king .
Dan dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed that his wife had been un@@ fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
I will meet you at the station at 1@@ 0 a@@ .@@ m .
any play op@@ ening to bad re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws won &apos;t last long .
you can &apos;t smo@@ ke in here .
how is it that you know so much about Japanese hi@@ story ?
I was surprised to hear of his fa@@ il@@ ure .
you should wash fr@@ u@@ it before you eat it .
Tom p@@ ou@@ red Mary a c@@ up of coffee .
he fell as@@ le@@ e@@ p d@@ ur@@ ing class .
put the e@@ g@@ gs in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
I want a hot sho@@ wer before I go back to work .
I ad@@ m@@ itted that she was right .
didn &apos;t I tell you so ?
we can believe everything .
there is no telling exactly when the ear@@ th was born .
I &apos;ll tell my m@@ om on you !
we used to s@@ it on these ste@@ ps and talk .
we have all kin@@ ds of time .
it is too dark for me to read .
why didn &apos;t you read the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ?
she &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
I can &apos;t understand why you are so cri@@ ti@@ cal of him .
my b@@ rain is fri@@ ed .
you aren &apos;t in a hurry , are you ?
are you afraid of it ?
she al@@ lowed him to go alone .
I think Tom killed himself .
my sk@@ ir@@ t is too long .
do you speak German ?
watch the fr@@ on@@ t .
I have only just arrived .
I have another en@@ g@@ ag@@ e@@ ment .
how does Tom plan to help ?
are you sta@@ ying for dinner ?
Tom will be here every day .
is this baby a he or a she ?
wh@@ e@@ ther to trans@@ late is a mor@@ al choice of the trans@@ lat@@ or . sometimes things are better to be left alone in the language which pro@@ du@@ ced them .
this man &apos;s ra@@ mb@@ l@@ ings are the f@@ ur@@ the@@ st from the truth I &apos;ve ever heard !
I can hear you l@@ ou@@ d and clear .
we &apos;ll do the same for you .
Tom is con@@ stan@@ tly com@@ pla@@ ining .
Tom never learned how to read and write .
we &apos;ve looked every@@ where , haven &apos;t we ?
are you telling me you don &apos;t love me anymore ?
it &apos;s really c@@ ool here .
Ch@@ ar@@ les pe@@ el@@ s your b@@ an@@ an@@ a .
I advis@@ e you to be pun@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
I had a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood .

I haven &apos;t seen you in ages .
she used to keep a di@@ ary , but doesn &apos;t anymore .
some@@ body th@@ re@@ w a b@@ ri@@ ck through my window .
is it possible to buy p@@ ot@@ ato@@ es here ?
over the wee@@ k@@ end I went out to dinner with this married cou@@ ple that I met through a mu@@ tu@@ al friend and we all w@@ ound up going home together .
I couldn &apos;t br@@ ing myself to tell her the truth .
I s@@ at at the b@@ ar .
Tom wants people to p@@ ity him .
I had to c@@ li@@ m@@ b over the f@@ ence .
I &apos;ll do anything I can for Tom .
I advis@@ e you to not dis@@ cour@@ age me !
she nee@@ ded the enti@@ re af@@ ternoon for that job .
I thought that was the right thing to do .
l@@ os@@ ing your health is wor@@ se than l@@ os@@ ing your money .
it &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
I know that you don &apos;t speak French very well .
this conf@@ er@@ ence at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted 1@@ 5@@ 0 di@@ p@@ lo@@ mat@@ s .

how does your opinion diff@@ er from his ?
I &apos;m con@@ ser@@ v@@ a@@ tive .
did I do something wrong ?
you &apos;re f@@ lu@@ ent in French , right ?
this is too small a house for us to live in .
can you show it to me ?
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
when do you in@@ t@@ end to qu@@ it smoking ?
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll p@@ ass the coming ex@@ am .

I came here to meet you .

he was happy for a time .
I don &apos;t like h@@ or@@ r@@ or movi@@ es .
I know you &apos;ve been trying to help .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
you still haven &apos;t told me why you decided not to go .
some@@ body &apos;s waiting for you .

Tom is a P@@ ee@@ ping Tom .

he wants to mar@@ ry my daughter .
you were list@@ ening .
F@@ ill in this for@@ m .
I wasn &apos;t at home last night .

I told Tom I wanted to go with him .
the r@@ oo@@ ms in this hotel are not as cle@@ an as the r@@ oo@@ ms in that hotel .
I took a sho@@ wer .
I had a hea@@ d@@ ac@@ he , so I couldn &apos;t do that .

I promise I &apos;ll be qui@@ et .
is there a differ@@ ence between the way of thinking of men and women ?
we are a@@ waiting im@@ pati@@ en@@ tly the arri@@ v@@ al of our d@@ ear friend .

I love Sami so much .
we found something .
I tal@@ ked with her for an h@@ our .

who could have expe@@ cted that it would happen ?
I &apos;ll keep your advice in mind .
where do you plan to go on vac@@ ation next summer ?
this ri@@ ce has too much sa@@ f@@ fr@@ on .
he tried to give up smoking but in v@@ ain .
Tom should at least wear a ti@@ e .
do you want to come al@@ ong and give it a go ?
he turned p@@ al@@ e the in@@ st@@ ant he saw her .
I want to visit Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a one day .

I often spend my free time list@@ ening to music .

I have seen a U@@ F@@ O .
you can &apos;t er@@ ase the past .
kis@@ sing a person who smo@@ kes is like li@@ c@@ king an as@@ h@@ tr@@ ay .
there &apos;s nothing I can do to dis@@ su@@ a@@ de him .
why are you cr@@ ying ?
you must not en@@ ter the room .
the p@@ ool is fu@@ ll .
Sami did the right thing , I think .
you don &apos;t necess@@ ar@@ ily have to go .
you have to work , not think .
we do not have enough st@@ ren@@ g@@ th to fol@@ low our reas@@ on fu@@ l@@ ly .

I know you &apos;ve got a gu@@ n .
cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds are us@@ eful but dang@@ er@@ ous .

A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a is a very important par@@ t@@ ner country for the E@@ uro@@ pe@@ an Un@@ ion .
what did you do then ?
I &apos;ll find another job .
I saw him kis@@ sing another girl .
she took the pho@@ to back in her hands .
you are in part respon@@ sible for it .
this is tri@@ cky .

I don &apos;t care how old you are .
you can &apos;t both be telling the truth .
he in@@ ten@@ ds to buy a new bicycle .
his succ@@ ess is out of question .
she tel@@ ls him to give her all of his sal@@ ary and he does .
I never w@@ in .
let &apos;s find a safe place to hi@@ de .
I s@@ at between Tom and J@@ o@@ h@@ n .
at that time , bicy@@ c@@ les were just star@@ ting to get popu@@ lar and , here and there , there were many un@@ sk@@ illed beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers who r@@ an into people and bro@@ ke through their he@@ d@@ g@@ es .
please do as it seems best to you .
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants .
the li@@ br@@ ar@@ ian said we nee@@ ded to be qui@@ et .
B@@ er@@ n@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tre@@ s used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ f@@ s on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers of gi@@ an@@ ts , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ at@@ er dist@@ ance , not by vir@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of si@@ ght on our part , or any ph@@ y@@ sic@@ al dist@@ in@@ ction , but because we are car@@ ried high and ra@@ is@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .
is it true that Tom won the r@@ ace ?
there &apos;s a black ho@@ le at the cen@@ ter of our g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
he comes to meet me sometimes .
a f@@ use has b@@ lo@@ wn .
I might be back before you leave .
pri@@ ces went up .
get my ri@@ f@@ le .
boys will be boys , girls will be girls .
I had some things to do .
have you ever made a pi@@ e before ?
my leaving early made them feel sorry .
you said you fi@@ g@@ ured out why .
how did that whole thing happen ?
you aren &apos;t the eas@@ i@@ est person to live with .
go up these sta@@ irs .
why do you want to di@@ e ?
Tom is hi@@ ding in the at@@ tic .
Tom has de@@ par@@ ted for Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a .

you were working yesterday af@@ ternoon , wer@@ en &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ve got to han@@ g up now . someone is waiting to use the phone .
b@@ read and milk are good foo@@ ds .
I sing the s@@ ong of him whose b@@ read I eat .
the a@@ ir@@ port is quite far from the city cen@@ t@@ re .
we know that he &apos;s a b@@ ra@@ ve man .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the E@@ uro@@ pe@@ an Un@@ ion was cre@@ ated as a re@@ sul@@ t of a des@@ i@@ re to ri@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve French @-@ German en@@ m@@ ity .
don &apos;t forget your mother &apos;s bir@@ thday !

Sami felt tr@@ app@@ ed .
how could anybody not like this ?
go to the par@@ k .
they need him .
God is .
can I have a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a , please ?
I know where you live .
I think what you say is true .
I think we should all go to Tom &apos;s house .
that was because my watch was five minutes s@@ low .
that &apos;s only a to@@ y .
he almost con@@ v@@ in@@ ced me .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
I we@@ i@@ gh about 6@@ 0 k@@ il@@ o@@ s .
he sa@@ ved money for the trip .
one of the pla@@ y@@ ers took off his shirt .
it wasn &apos;t all that f@@ un@@ ny .
I used to look up to him , but not anymore .
swimming is easy for me .
S@@ ele@@ ct ac@@ tion for Ch@@ r@@ is .
are you l@@ os@@ ing your mind ?
how was the f@@ light ?
when did I tell you that ?
by the time you got there , the su@@ n had set .
why don &apos;t I call you ?
all languages are e@@ qu@@ al , but English is more e@@ qu@@ al than the others .
you must take your coat in c@@ ase it should become cold .
bu@@ tt@@ on your coat up .
she &apos;s un@@ f@@ it for the job .
these pl@@ ates aren &apos;t cle@@ an .

she ba@@ ked an app@@ le pi@@ e .
Tom never li@@ ked school .
he re@@ mo@@ ved his s@@ un@@ gl@@ asses .
she was a@@ ma@@ zed to hear the news .
if you want .
don &apos;t take any no@@ ti@@ ce of what he sa@@ ys .
can you tell me why Tom hasn &apos;t done that ?
it &apos;s si@@ mp@@ le and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
where do you think we came from ?
I &apos;m sorry , I couldn &apos;t hear you .
in the se@@ a , there are as many fish as you like .
you don &apos;t need to w@@ ra@@ p it .
maybe we really are alone .
she es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally likes music .
the ear@@ th tra@@ vel@@ s in an or@@ bit around the su@@ n .
I didn &apos;t reali@@ ze you were a@@ wake .
isn &apos;t anybody going to say con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions ?
he should have arrived already .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to the party .
am I dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing something ?

that would be che@@ ating .
I have once lived in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing , but now live in S@@ e@@ ou@@ l .
the ru@@ m@@ or turned out true .
if I had it all to do over again , I wouldn &apos;t change a thing .
su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , the light went out .
I like a@@ st@@ ro@@ lo@@ gy .

I think Tom was looking for you .
I think I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have married you .
I was born on J@@ un@@ e 4 , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 4 .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
the f@@ ly run@@ ning on the m@@ ir@@ r@@ or doesn &apos;t worry about its ref@@ le@@ ction on the po@@ in@@ ts of its le@@ gs from which it s@@ its and run@@ s ; but on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it se@@ es on the sm@@ oo@@ th sur@@ face a qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of very small things which inter@@ est it and which we conf@@ use with d@@ ust and g@@ ri@@ me .
there are eyes that give light , and others that re@@ cei@@ ve it .

Tom tried to che@@ er Mary up .
A@@ n@@ n@@ a is a friend whose sup@@ port I can coun@@ t on .
there is a little water left .
three children were playing in the par@@ k .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
didn &apos;t your parents teac@@ h you anything ?
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?

it was one of the best experi@@ en@@ ces of my life .
I don &apos;t drink a lot of beer .
I &apos;m so wor@@ n out !
don &apos;t ever talk to me again .
as he gre@@ w exc@@ ited , he spo@@ ke more and more r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly .
this is not the first time this has happened .
hurry up , gu@@ ys .
you have a vis@@ it@@ or .
you &apos;re not as beautiful as you think you are .
H@@ u@@ m@@ ans are strang@@ e an@@ im@@ als .

we &apos;ve lost our u@@ mb@@ rel@@ l@@ as .
I &apos;m w@@ il@@ ling to take care of your children , if you want me to .

be careful what you wish for .
I should get back up@@ sta@@ irs .
Tom may have mis@@ sed the bus .

you &apos;re not safe here .
nice shot !
you can easily i@@ d@@ enti@@ f@@ y him because he is very t@@ all .
you should call the poli@@ ce .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
ang@@ er is a for@@ m of ma@@ d@@ ness .
he is very sen@@ si@@ tive to cold .

do you need a ri@@ de ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to lose .
she &apos;s ol@@ der than you think .
the cost of living is very high in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o .
I &apos;m not qu@@ ali@@ fied to do that .
I don &apos;t care about what they say .
ill@@ ness for@@ ced him to give up school .

R@@ e@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves from many coun@@ tri@@ es have par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in this conf@@ er@@ ence .

try to sleep .
keep Tom safe .
I wish she &apos;d stop smoking .
today , I do not have hou@@ se@@ work to do .
he &apos;s trying hard .
father is angry with me .
it &apos;s already 1@@ 1 .
speaking French is difficult .
he com@@ man@@ ded me to leave the be@@ d@@ room immedi@@ ately .
be@@ coming too f@@ at is not good for one &apos;s health .
S@@ te@@ ve did not come home .
you &apos;re a dea@@ d man .

how are you g@@ on@@ n@@ a dea@@ l with it ?
I was im@@ pres@@ sed with her work .
