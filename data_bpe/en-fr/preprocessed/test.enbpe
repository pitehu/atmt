j@@ ack was too la@@ zy to give them a call , so they decided to walk without him .
why didn &apos;t you do it ?
it is on this point that our opin@@ ions diff@@ er .
she lived a lon@@ ely life .
didn &apos;t Tom tell you anything ?
I know what a st@@ ap@@ ler is .

I wanted to know why you didn &apos;t come yesterday .
that gu@@ y has a s@@ cre@@ w lo@@ ose !
Tom didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
he had dinner by himself .
O@@ ri@@ on is sa@@ f@@ ely back to Ear@@ th .
everybody had a good year .
I told him not to come back .
I would rather not go .

th@@ an@@ ks to this book , I learned some interest@@ ing f@@ ac@@ ts about this in@@ se@@ ct .
I think Tom is a@@ wake .
there was always too much su@@ per@@ f@@ lu@@ ous wr@@ iting in his es@@ sa@@ ys .
I fi@@ g@@ ured you &apos;d be here .
we c@@ ha@@ t@@ ted together .
have you tried this water ?
to become a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ an@@ j@@ o pla@@ y@@ er , you need to spend th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds of hours pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing .
I must &apos;ve par@@ ked my car el@@ se@@ where .
at the most , the trip will cost $ 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 .
you speak my language .
he doesn &apos;t like to wait until the last mo@@ ment to do something .
this is correct .
she had to sh@@ are a be@@ d@@ room with her sister .
is he a friend of yours ?
these c@@ ha@@ irs are different .
how can one be ser@@ ious with the world when the world it@@ self is so ri@@ di@@ cu@@ l@@ ous !
&quot; look - there &apos;s a fire ! ! &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ed Dan .
you can &apos;t buy this medi@@ c@@ ine without a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
do you remember his tele@@ phone number ?
Tom , who is kind , will be glad to do anything for me .
it won &apos;t be easy to forget you .
are you looking for your parents ?
I want to thank you for hel@@ ping me .
what are you doing now ?
those who have a long hair own a ha@@ ir@@ dri@@ er .
you were s@@ car@@ ed , wer@@ en &apos;t you ?
is it your bi@@ ke ?
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
what stu@@ f@@ f is this j@@ ac@@ ket made of ?
call a doctor qu@@ ick@@ ly !
Tom told the poli@@ ce everything he knew .
I &apos;m not e@@ mb@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sed at all .
who would you like to speak to ?
I &apos;d like to help them if I can .
do you know where the others are ?
Tom pre@@ ten@@ ded that he didn &apos;t see it .
this car looks pretty c@@ ool .
have you ever c@@ li@@ mb@@ ed M@@ t . F@@ u@@ j@@ i ?
she &apos;s wa@@ sh@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es .

I don &apos;t like tra@@ vel@@ ing alone .
I think we &apos;re all a bit cu@@ ck@@ o@@ o .
I think Tom is am@@ using .
I ate a light lunch .
what are you wr@@ iting ?
I still have other things to do .
he chang@@ ed his ad@@ dress .
you can tell me anything .
&quot; is he ali@@ ve or dea@@ d ? &quot; &quot; he &apos;s ali@@ ve . &quot;
tell me about your wife .
they are very com@@ pati@@ ble .
it doesn &apos;t b@@ el@@ ong to you .
there &apos;s a table .
she wor@@ ked for a rich man .
having finished the work , he went to bed .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV many times .
are you up ?
he was pati@@ ent .
the op@@ er@@ ation was really touch and go there for a@@ while but the doctor thinks he &apos;ll pu@@ ll through .
since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
my grand@@ father is still str@@ on@@ g@@ ly an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed in my heart .
don &apos;t th@@ row anything on@@ to the flo@@ or .
no , just the one .
I &apos;m b@@ re@@ ast @-@ f@@ ee@@ ding my baby .
I always have a good sup@@ p@@ ly of tis@@ su@@ es in my po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Tom is a re@@ b@@ el@@ li@@ ous boy .
I think I know the answer .

I didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
look at it clos@@ ely .
P@@ u@@ a is sing@@ ing at ch@@ ur@@ ch .

I can walk to school in ten minutes .
Tom is hard up for money .
I can &apos;t promise anything , but I &apos;ll do my best .
thank you for making it so easy .
I want you to meet my parents .
my father doesn &apos;t eat fr@@ u@@ it that much .
I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing a pic@@ ture of my grand@@ mother on the w@@ all .
I don &apos;t know where to go or what to do .
you know everybody .

I re@@ la@@ yed the me@@ s@@ s@@ age to Tom .
you &apos;ll soon get used to speaking in pu@@ b@@ lic .
does that trouble you ?
are you laugh@@ ing at me ?
Tom wa@@ sh@@ es his hair every day .
Tom &apos;s friends called him Mr money b@@ ag@@ s .
we &apos;ll never know the truth about his death .
all you have to do is wait .
what is it this time ?
I took her ar@@ m .
it must be morning , for the bir@@ ds are sing@@ ing .
I would have bought that car if I &apos;d had the money .
this word is both a n@@ ou@@ n and a ver@@ b .
she ir@@ on@@ ed his shir@@ ts .
I think you should open an ac@@ coun@@ t here .
have you ever read any Ch@@ in@@ ese po@@ e@@ ms ?
how do you know which one is yours ?
you won &apos;t go , will you ?
this is do@@ able .
as I thought , she &apos;s a vir@@ g@@ in !

he &apos;s wr@@ iting a long letter .
you must take care of your dog yourself .
he enjo@@ yed himself .
the re@@ sul@@ ts were ne@@ ga@@ tive .
the Japanese eat ri@@ ce at least once a day .
I cat@@ ch the fl@@ u every year .
that &apos;s why I sent for you .
it ta@@ st@@ es very good .
O@@ h , I haven &apos;t decided what I &apos;m going to do yet .
at this time , there &apos;s no sa@@ f@@ er place to be than right here .
there are many tou@@ ri@@ sts in the city on ho@@ li@@ days .
he likes wal@@ king in the par@@ k .
do you think so ?
stay out of the water .
Tom clos@@ ed the door of his be@@ d@@ room .
