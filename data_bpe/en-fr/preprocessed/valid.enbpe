he see@@ med to like that .
Sami and L@@ ay@@ la were ea@@ g@@ er@@ ly a@@ waiting the arri@@ v@@ al of their baby .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what had happened .
it &apos;s as if I had always known how it all was going to end .
I saw the f@@ ile .
the c@@ ine@@ m@@ a is bur@@ sting at the se@@ am@@ s .
this job will call for a lot of money .
she is a doctor and also an al@@ p@@ in@@ ist .
in a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , it &apos;s important for the pre@@ ss to be in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent .

some people are just we@@ ir@@ d .
we like Tom .
we had a secre@@ t meeting .
I &apos;m off to the g@@ y@@ m .
do you care for cl@@ as@@ sic@@ al music ?
everyone is uni@@ qu@@ e .

we really enjo@@ yed our@@ sel@@ ves .
I can &apos;t pay the ren@@ t .
Tom almost always ig@@ no@@ res my advice .
I want you to l@@ ay back and re@@ la@@ x .
that &apos;ll make me happy .
look !
why don &apos;t we go out and get dr@@ unk ?
I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re busy . please help me now .
I wanted to speak with you first .
this room is cold .
the watch doesn &apos;t work .
I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;d no@@ ti@@ ced .

M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys do not com@@ pl@@ ain about not having been made into men .
what do you call this an@@ i@@ mal in Japanese ?
I &apos;ll turn it into a house .
do you know if Tom can speak French ?
this is the same ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ace that I lost yesterday .
we &apos;d be very interested in what you think .
the r@@ at was killed by Tom with a st@@ ic@@ k .
the in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of the is@@ land are t@@ all and str@@ ong .
I &apos;ve always wanted to visit T@@ ur@@ key .
I had a t@@ oo@@ th@@ ac@@ he yesterday .
you have no ca@@ use for ang@@ er .
all pre@@ pos@@ i@@ tions take the no@@ min@@ a@@ tive .

the bar@@ o@@ me@@ ter is fal@@ ling . it is going to rain .
if there &apos;s anything I can do to help , please let me know .
I have a feeling you &apos;ll be a very good la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
some people are reading some ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es on the train .
let &apos;s take a trip .
I thought I was about to be cap@@ tur@@ ed so I r@@ an as fast as I could .
you don &apos;t o@@ we me anything .

I bought a ca@@ mer@@ a for thir@@ ty do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .

I &apos;m lo@@ ad@@ ed .
how did you meet him ?
I thought about you the other day .
he rea@@ ds French .
I sle@@ pt n@@ ine hours .
no one tru@@ sts her .
why don &apos;t we talk about something else ?
the ma@@ yo@@ r ad@@ min@@ i@@ st@@ ers the af@@ fa@@ irs of the city .
Tom is a tim@@ id young man .
she won@@ dered where S@@ am was and what he was doing .
we &apos;re on the same side .
things are only going to get wor@@ se .
nothing happened to Mary . she just forgot to call .
that is the thing that concer@@ n@@ s you .
the f@@ is@@ hing bo@@ at that had been mis@@ sing re@@ turned to its port sa@@ f@@ ely .
I want to stay in the house .
are you afraid of death ?
tomorrow will be even war@@ m@@ er than today .
we eat so we may live .
when is good for you ?
my father was sa@@ d for the whole day as he had lost his wal@@ let .
I don &apos;t care how much you say you love me . I know your feel@@ ings for her haven &apos;t chang@@ ed .
he left home early in the morning so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble .
what the fu@@ ck is going on here ?
the os@@ tri@@ ch has win@@ gs , but it cannot f@@ ly .
I was a bit dis@@ appoin@@ ted .
I lost your phone number .
a ro@@ pe was th@@ ro@@ wn into the water .
it being S@@ un@@ day , the sho@@ p was clos@@ ed .
J@@ e@@ an and K@@ ate are tw@@ ins .
who did this ?
how many children do you have ?
it wouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se me .
are you ser@@ i@@ ously thinking about not going ?
he told the b@@ oss some co@@ ck@@ a@@ ma@@ mi@@ e story about being sick and nee@@ ding days off from work .
read it to me .
is that all you can talk about - the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t ?
I &apos;ll call you back later .
he was ch@@ os@@ en cap@@ tain .
thank you very much .
she doesn &apos;t understand s@@ ar@@ c@@ as@@ m .

he is f@@ on@@ d of pain@@ ting .
P@@ o@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans never tell us their in@@ ner th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
I &apos;ve got work to do here .
I &apos;ve enjo@@ yed talking to you .
her job is to t@@ y@@ pe .
Tom was ab@@ du@@ cted .
you can &apos;t dance , can you ?
I ac@@ ce@@ pt your ap@@ olo@@ gy .
should I be talking to Tom ?
I need to know where you are .
what did I say yesterday ?
he spea@@ ks as if he were an exper@@ t .
we have a good team and everyone knows it .
I &apos;m watching the mar@@ ket clos@@ ely .
I have no i@@ mag@@ in@@ ation .
she is good at sk@@ i@@ ing .
keep dri@@ ving .
I don &apos;t need your help anymore .
I &apos;ll see to it .
we &apos;ll talk about this tomorrow .
she is P@@ i@@ er@@ ro@@ t &apos;s sister .
the la@@ ke is de@@ e@@ p@@ est here .
he was sen@@ ten@@ ced to pri@@ son .
an experi@@ en@@ ced heal@@ er can li@@ ft cur@@ ses and di@@ sp@@ el e@@ vi@@ l eyes .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
don &apos;t open your u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la in the ha@@ ll .
let &apos;s go to an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat place and have a big dinner .
are you at@@ te@@ mp@@ ting to b@@ ri@@ be me ?

we pic@@ ked flow@@ ers together .

I li@@ ked working with you .
G@@ oo@@ d@@ night .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
he re@@ je@@ cted our off@@ er .
Tom found a job as a me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic .
I &apos;ll have a na@@ p after lunch .
if he as@@ ks me that question , I won &apos;t answer .
I &apos;m not good @-@ looking .
were you a@@ wake at 2 : 3@@ 0 last night ?
why don &apos;t you stay a while ?
he r@@ an to his mother in the li@@ br@@ ary .
some water , please .
would you please s@@ low down ?
there &apos;s room in@@ side .
Tom was reading a book while list@@ ening to music .
Tom nee@@ ded your help .
we &apos;re all in this together .
may I try it on ?
close your eyes and tell me what you hear .
how does Tom plan to help ?
he &apos;s ad@@ di@@ cted to j@@ unk food .
you &apos;re all alone .
they app@@ ro@@ ve .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I can dri@@ ve to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of g@@ as .
why don &apos;t you pu@@ ll over ?
why don &apos;t you meet me out fr@@ on@@ t in a few minutes ?
Sami feel@@ s so s@@ car@@ ed .
it is necess@@ ary for you to stop smoking .
I &apos;ve never come ac@@ r@@ oss such a strang@@ e c@@ ase .
the company has hard and fast ru@@ les against lat@@ en@@ ess .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zed .
she &apos;s a yo@@ g@@ a in@@ stru@@ ctor .
nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jo@@ kes .
it &apos;s hard to do that .
once a teacher , always a teacher .
Tom was playing go@@ l@@ f that morning .
does your dog b@@ ite ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
brea@@ the , d@@ am@@ n you !
what he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I &apos;m not your ser@@ v@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther to c@@ ry or to lau@@ gh .
how come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
what did you do with that ?
A@@ d@@ ding up nu@@ mb@@ ers is very up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
can I make co@@ pi@@ es ?
you won &apos;t di@@ e today .
I hi@@ d it some@@ where .
Sami has been sick .
are you still up@@ set about what happened ?
she used mar@@ gar@@ ine in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of bu@@ tter .
I &apos;ll dri@@ ve you some@@ where .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
we have to learn all the s@@ on@@ gs before the end of the week .
would you like to visit the city ?
this gu@@ y &apos;s great at p@@ it@@ ching cur@@ v@@ eb@@ al@@ ls .
one wee@@ k@@ end all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the city were fu@@ ll because there was a large con@@ ven@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few wee@@ ks left .
she got all f@@ lu@@ st@@ ered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
there &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
that hat be@@ comes you .
how long does it take to walk from here to the city ha@@ ll ?
he drea@@ med about his home .
they have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .
he was leaving then .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the lat@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
come again ?
I saw the cake you made .
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er .
where are your friends going ?
as the door sli@@ d open , he almost fell on@@ to the pl@@ at@@ for@@ m .
can you use a computer ?
that &apos;s a lot of c@@ as@@ h .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never for@@ give me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
what time do you want me to pic@@ k you up ?
you got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t walk anymore .
I@@ r@@ an is not I@@ ra@@ q .
his de@@ b@@ ts am@@ oun@@ t to two mil@@ li@@ on do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .
Tom &apos;s eyes were fu@@ ll of t@@ ears .
what is today &apos;s d@@ ate ?
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you so much , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I just in@@ ven@@ ted a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ ess@@ or en@@ ab@@ ling to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce them b@@ ac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
the old man started to lau@@ gh sa@@ dly .
I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
who will correct my mista@@ kes ?
do you think it was easy for me ?
I s@@ c@@ rea@@ med but nobody could hear me .
can anyone dri@@ ve ?
I am very ill at e@@ ase with strang@@ ers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two wee@@ ks have pas@@ sed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ ar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they ad@@ m@@ itted that they &apos;d li@@ ed .
I don &apos;t like swimming in p@@ oo@@ ls .
can you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of this sen@@ t@@ ence ?
the man was hi@@ ding in a den@@ se fore@@ st .
I know that this is we@@ ir@@ d .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le ?
he can har@@ dly speak any English .
I had my watch men@@ ded .
we can help you .
are you inv@@ ol@@ ved in poli@@ tic@@ s ?
b@@ low out the c@@ and@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t enti@@ re@@ ly sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to li@@ e .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
the truth is I told a li@@ e .
Tom has the experience necess@@ ary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fire .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still as@@ le@@ e@@ p .
I took over the bus@@ iness from F@@ a@@ ther .
o@@ il is expen@@ sive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that he and L@@ in@@ d@@ a were getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great pleas@@ ure for me to trans@@ late the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu@@ gg@@ age ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k@@ id in a can@@ dy store .
M@@ a@@ ths is a good sub@@ ject .
you really speak French well .
for ex@@ am@@ ple , more people are cho@@ os@@ ing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you ser@@ i@@ ously thinking about going ?
it was a pleas@@ ure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll di@@ e .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I r@@ an out@@ side and the door lo@@ cked it@@ self behind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ pro@@ du@@ ctive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im@@ pati@@ en@@ tly .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a pan@@ the@@ ist .
I like both sci@@ ence and mat@@ h .
we &apos;re not cer@@ tain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not im@@ possible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has re@@ quest@@ ed my as@@ si@@ st@@ ance .
do you want to get us both killed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at ex@@ pla@@ ining things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a tra@@ ine@@ e .
how much are you being pa@@ id to do this ?
she was lo@@ ved by everybody in the v@@ ill@@ age .
where do you train your students ?
have you seen my ca@@ mer@@ a ?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded .
this book is too large to go in my po@@ cket .
could you please over@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a bo@@ y@@ friend .
I hate that gu@@ y .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he bor@@ row@@ ed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in Ch@@ in@@ a .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this pho@@ to .
would you like to read this ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ?
he took char@@ ge of the fir@@ m after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usu@@ ally tal@@ ked to each other in French .
I f@@ illed up the v@@ ase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who sa@@ ys that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play ch@@ ess ?
this bicycle is mine . yours is over there .
it &apos;s an e@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy !
for me , the rea@@ l world is just a f@@ ic@@ tion .
speaking of f@@ il@@ ms , why not go to the c@@ ine@@ m@@ a tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
anything you want , my d@@ ear .
she at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted me at first si@@ ght .
that is the f@@ un@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever heard .
he promis@@ ed to pro@@ vi@@ de infor@@ mation .
I &apos;m taking care of it . you can re@@ la@@ x . you can re@@ ly on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spo@@ ken to your French teacher and he sa@@ ys you &apos;re doing well in his class .
everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
she likes to go to the li@@ br@@ ary .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it mat@@ ters to me .
the cold a@@ ir re@@ vi@@ ved Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she te@@ mp@@ ted him .
everyone can make a differ@@ ence in their own lives and th@@ er@@ e@@ by col@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once up@@ on a time there lived an e@@ m@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more coun@@ tri@@ es than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t sp@@ l@@ as@@ h me !
Tom har@@ dly spo@@ ke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ n@@ on .
everyone is free to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a gu@@ y ne@@ ar@@ ly r@@ an into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished bus@@ iness .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ il@@ ling .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good rea@@ der , read ; if a writ@@ er , write .
I hate those sp@@ i@@ d@@ ers . they &apos;re always there to f@@ rea@@ k me out when I &apos;m cle@@ an@@ ing .
no such person ex@@ i@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she advis@@ ed him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a jo@@ ke .
can you put the children to bed ?
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e &apos;s hi@@ ding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day ?
he wrote a no@@ vel b@@ as@@ ed on an@@ ci@@ ent my@@ ths .
Tom went ro@@ ck c@@ li@@ mb@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t touch this !
you &apos;ve been war@@ ned .
he pla@@ ys the pian@@ o very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicycle ?
she has good i@@ dea@@ s .
what a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble thing !
we have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a tra@@ it@@ or .
we take ri@@ s@@ ks all the time .
Z@@ a@@ il@@ a@@ i@@ b@@ a b@@ ar is hi@@ ring wa@@ it@@ ers ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right ar@@ m .
I tried fl@@ ying from the top of the t@@ ree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes li@@ e on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you br@@ ought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we as@@ su@@ me that he is hon@@ est .
are you all right ?
wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever road you may take , it will lea@@ d to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mis@@ underst@@ ood you .
where can I find a ta@@ x@@ i ?
she &apos;s going through a mi@@ d@@ life cri@@ s@@ is .
the res@@ cu@@ ed re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es were lon@@ g@@ ing for f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om .
stop su@@ c@@ king up to the teacher .
re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly s@@ la@@ mming the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how man@@ ag@@ ed to get the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch di@@ sen@@ g@@ ag@@ ed so I could just about dri@@ ve for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interested .
the house is bur@@ ning !
we consi@@ der Tom hon@@ est .
I &apos;ll give you a si@@ mp@@ le ex@@ am@@ ple .
win@@ ds from the se@@ a are mo@@ ist .
we have arrived safe and s@@ ound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
Mr W@@ il@@ son is pr@@ ou@@ d of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be hel@@ d re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the weather .
in the A@@ r@@ c@@ tic there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , na@@ i@@ ve and in@@ experi@@ en@@ ced .
