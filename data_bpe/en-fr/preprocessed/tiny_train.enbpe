today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six windo@@ ws on the f@@ ac@@ a@@ de ?
one should be resp@@ e@@ ct@@ ful of other &apos;s belie@@ f@@ s rather than mo@@ ck them .
people usu@@ ally di@@ e if you k@@ ill them .
it was working .
Tom nee@@ ds us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an ato@@ mi@@ c po@@ wer pl@@ ant .
when the al@@ ar@@ m clock go@@ es off , I don &apos;t mo@@ ve .
this feel@@ s like s@@ il@@ k .
a tra@@ ff@@ ic accident happened there .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sen@@ t@@ ence , fore@@ ver , dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed our Mary .
we im@@ port coffee from B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you sp@@ read your af@@ fa@@ irs too th@@ in .
those bo@@ x spea@@ k@@ ers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were h@@ ang@@ ing on her words .
in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of com@@ pla@@ ining , maybe you should help .
I think we can hand@@ le that .
I am de@@ e@@ p@@ ly interested in art .
you are old enough to know this .
I ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted his inv@@ it@@ ation .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing your new s@@ ong .
the children are going to the be@@ ach today .
can you believe this is really happ@@ ening ?
he pa@@ id the lo@@ an with inter@@ est .
I know you like cho@@ co@@ late .
I never me@@ ant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was run@@ ning by it@@ self .
for him , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce is a good in@@ ven@@ tion , with one so@@ le di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an com@@ mis@@ sion &apos;s re@@ comm@@ en@@ da@@ tions were ig@@ nor@@ ed .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
that &apos;s dou@@ b@@ t@@ ful .
she in@@ ten@@ ded to become an ac@@ tre@@ ss .
he is always ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on@@ less .
he has tra@@ vel@@ ed around the world in e@@ igh@@ ty days by himself .
b@@ la@@ me it on the weather .
I can ex@@ pl@@ ain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !
sha@@ me on you for your dis@@ cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ment !
he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get medi@@ cal in@@ sur@@ ance .
he went down the h@@ ill .
the girls gi@@ gg@@ led .
is anybody there ?
I &apos;m not s@@ car@@ ed of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned car@@ s and sm@@ as@@ hed sto@@ re@@ fr@@ on@@ t windo@@ ws .
I resi@@ g@@ n .
I know he is busy .
the man and his h@@ or@@ se that fell off the c@@ li@@ f@@ f were soon res@@ cu@@ ed .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a com@@ promise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bir@@ d in the hand is better than two in the bus@@ h .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ se@@ ction .
you look busy .
they all laugh@@ ed at their er@@ r@@ or .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the app@@ le you gave him .
bir@@ ds have ne@@ sts , sp@@ i@@ d@@ ers have we@@ b@@ s , and hu@@ m@@ ans have fri@@ en@@ d@@ shi@@ p .
ten years have g@@ one by .
I &apos;m tr@@ app@@ ed .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly ta@@ kes another pi@@ e@@ ce of cake .
I left behind some important do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the D@@ e@@ m@@ on , pl@@ ac@@ ing his hand up@@ on my head .
you should have st@@ op@@ ped .
he sp@@ ra@@ ined his an@@ k@@ le .
Tom looks ol@@ der than he really is .
I was watching the s@@ cen@@ e ho@@ l@@ ding my b@@ re@@ ath .
Mary got to know her bo@@ y@@ friend in Par@@ is .
hand in your p@@ ap@@ ers .
are you still married ?
you must pay in adv@@ ance .
in K@@ ab@@ y@@ li@@ a , we speak the K@@ ab@@ y@@ le language .
she turned a p@@ age of her book .
yes , you should wear red li@@ p@@ st@@ ic@@ k for V@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t inv@@ ited to par@@ ties often .
you see the words that I t@@ y@@ ped on the s@@ cre@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the t@@ ears that I sh@@ ed over the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your me@@ al ?
she lives near the be@@ ach .
I want to live in a ca@@ st@@ le .
don &apos;t you see the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n ?
I don &apos;t d@@ ate .
be resp@@ e@@ ct@@ ful .
he can swim fast .
he saw a pretty girl .
the windo@@ ws were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit c@@ ard at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary th@@ re@@ w a p@@ ot@@ a@@ to through the window .
everyone des@@ er@@ ves a secon@@ d chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy b@@ al@@ ance between or@@ ig@@ in@@ al@@ ity and st@@ ic@@ king to a st@@ ri@@ ct st@@ and@@ ard .
I remember meeting her some@@ where .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ g@@ ing home a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a .
here is where it all happ@@ ens .
soon your ef@@ for@@ ts will be re@@ war@@ ded .
is the coffee hot ?
th@@ an@@ ks for jo@@ ining us .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t tra@@ vel with us .
I wonder what happened to P@@ au@@ l .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s b@@ low@@ ing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we tal@@ ked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stu@@ p@@ id now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pic@@ tu@@ res .
what do you want the me@@ s@@ s@@ age to be ?
m@@ om said I caught a cold because I went out with w@@ et hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
r@@ ar@@ ely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ eful d@@ an@@ c@@ er .
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ t@@ act you .
do you want to jo@@ in me for lunch ?
all of these le@@ t@@ ters are ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his ke@@ ys .
you could coun@@ t to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laugh@@ ing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a tru@@ ck .
I don &apos;t want to get inv@@ ol@@ ved in that bus@@ iness .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
the boy was cle@@ ver enough to sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the sy@@ ste@@ m is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an ar@@ ti@@ st must have an e@@ ye for col@@ our .
O@@ h wo@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you s@@ ound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the me@@ ter .
T@@ ho@@ mas chang@@ ed into pro@@ p@@ er clo@@ thing .
my mother bought two bot@@ t@@ les of or@@ ang@@ e ju@@ ice .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the re@@ sul@@ t is better than I expe@@ cted .
I guess right n@@ ine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice pa@@ ir of le@@ gs .
it is by this reas@@ on that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the con@@ tr@@ ary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like be@@ e@@ f . ne@@ ither do I .
where did you go to school ?
please don &apos;t di@@ str@@ act me from my work .
by teac@@ hing , we learn .
I tell you a little secre@@ t .
I &apos;m not s@@ car@@ ed at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ an@@ i@@ ed by his girlfriend .
his office is near the train station .
Tom was sit@@ ting under a t@@ ree , drin@@ king wine .
I &apos;ve been ho@@ ping to meet you .
don &apos;t work too hard !
can you wash my je@@ ans ?
do you speak M@@ al@@ t@@ ese ?
I &apos;m as cu@@ ri@@ ous as you are .
O@@ h , how we laugh@@ ed !
what &apos;s your o@@ c@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion ?
that pic@@ ture does not do ju@@ st@@ ice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is w@@ ise who ne@@ ither ho@@ p@@ es no@@ r f@@ ears anything from the un@@ cer@@ tain future .
our class has tw@@ en@@ ty @-@ five boys and tw@@ en@@ ty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I re@@ ti@@ re , I will de@@ di@@ c@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .
it &apos;s mer@@ ely a jo@@ ke .
I do not have a sister .
S@@ am is two years you@@ ng@@ er than Tom .

what does your father like ?
what a cat@@ a@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he !
for the sh@@ ar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , no@@ r by ten@@ s , no@@ r by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds and by my@@ ri@@ a@@ ds . tr@@ ust me , there are more sh@@ ar@@ ks in the se@@ a than mor@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is terri@@ fied of everything that is not it@@ self .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I drea@@ m@@ t about a few wee@@ ks ago .
you &apos;re not dea@@ d yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expen@@ sive .
who is the person in char@@ ge ?
trying to find happ@@ iness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
he a@@ ven@@ g@@ ed his dea@@ d father .
she li@@ ked that .
I &apos;m sor@@ e all over .
why don &apos;t you s@@ it down ?

I &apos;m doing you a fav@@ or .
you were afraid , wer@@ en &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the ta@@ st@@ e of on@@ ions .
they never re@@ turned to their country .
when do you me@@ an to start ?
why do the star@@ s tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she n@@ am@@ ed him Ch@@ ar@@ les .
she s@@ an@@ g better than him .
I made a pro@@ pos@@ al .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or .
I don &apos;t know her ad@@ dress .
I don &apos;t b@@ la@@ me you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in K@@ yo@@ to .
I think you &apos;re too pic@@ k@@ y .
I opened the window to let in some f@@ re@@ sh a@@ ir .
I could not stop laugh@@ ing .
pre@@ ss any key to con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ e .

they col@@ le@@ cted sh@@ el@@ ls on the be@@ ach .
what exactly did you say ?
he set off to Par@@ is .
the me@@ s@@ sen@@ ger left for L@@ on@@ don in secre@@ t .
there &apos;s no way I &apos;m going to work on S@@ un@@ day .

a@@ ir is a mi@@ x@@ ture of v@@ ar@@ ious g@@ as@@ es .
M@@ is@@ underst@@ and@@ ings do o@@ c@@ cu@@ r .
are you going to be O@@ K ?
what &apos;s going on with you ? you haven &apos;t been talking to me for a while now .

M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el J@@ ac@@ k@@ son died .

Sami &apos;s plan@@ e cr@@ as@@ hed in the fi@@ el@@ d .
he doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;m all set .
my computer won &apos;t start any more .
I &apos;ve been in Boston for less than a month .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
did you find the differ@@ ence between these two pho@@ to@@ s ?
it seems that the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on has set in .
I told you that was ri@@ di@@ cu@@ l@@ ous .
what was the col@@ or of the app@@ le he gave you ?
they sur@@ vi@@ ved , even th@@ ough the buil@@ ding was de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
who wants to go sho@@ p@@ ping ?
he must have been crazy to say such a thing .
my heart was p@@ oun@@ ding as my turn got ne@@ ar@@ er .
that &apos;s not fa@@ ir ! you saw my car@@ ds in the m@@ ir@@ r@@ or !
she was so beautiful that the mer@@ ch@@ ant &apos;s son could not help k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to kis@@ s her hand .
I am laugh@@ ing so that you will be happy .
if I knew you better , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s I would have let you in .
I want to go there once again .
I &apos;m beg@@ in@@ ning to get used to doing this .
he wrote a book about his con@@ ver@@ sion to I@@ s@@ la@@ m .
I found it in the at@@ tic .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ t@@ act you .
I inv@@ ited her to a movie .
Tom sa@@ ys it as it is .

I hel@@ ped my parents with the hou@@ se@@ work .
he knows M@@ r@@ . D@@ a@@ vi@@ d@@ son well .
get back to where you started .
that is of no use to me .
get me all the infor@@ mation you can on this matter .
I went to Boston by train .
maybe Tom should pay more at@@ tention in class .
you were sleeping , wer@@ en &apos;t you ?
there are no d@@ ru@@ gs here .

they &apos;ve cr@@ os@@ sed the bor@@ der .

please f@@ ill out this quest@@ i@@ on@@ na@@ i@@ re and s@@ end it to us .
I want to be alone for a while .

I &apos;m playing with my friends .

don &apos;t ch@@ eat .
may I take your order ?
I don &apos;t understand and I &apos;m not used to not underst@@ an@@ ding . please ex@@ pl@@ ain it once more .
Tom dr@@ ank st@@ ra@@ ight from the bot@@ t@@ le .
start at once , or you will be late .
I or@@ dered you a drink .
they have g@@ one far away .
he probably didn &apos;t have se@@ x with her .
please call him up .
H@@ ey , your dog just bit me .
I es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally like your cho@@ co@@ late cake .
Tom is the tal@@ le@@ st gu@@ y I &apos;ve ever seen .
you should not go alone .
that &apos;s your du@@ ty .
the doctor advis@@ ed that she take a ho@@ li@@ day .

I &apos;d like to tell you something in pri@@ v@@ ate .
do not inter@@ f@@ ere !
he took her in his ar@@ ms .

I would like to go , but I don &apos;t have a car .
he foo@@ led her .

I &apos;m waiting for my friend .
I often s@@ it up late at night to read .
I guess I &apos;ll have to think it over .
what &apos;s that pic@@ ture in@@ side your lo@@ ck@@ er ?
who &apos;s in comm@@ and here ?
le@@ t@@ ters are de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed every day .
have you learned nothing from your mista@@ kes ?

after ten years as bus@@ iness par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , they decided to part ways .
read as much as possible .
I have y@@ a@@ w@@ ned .

I had a ra@@ in@@ coat on so I didn &apos;t get so w@@ et .
there is no telling how far sci@@ ence may have pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sed by the end of the tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y .
I don &apos;t see your name on the li@@ st .
he mis@@ sed class .
forget about this gu@@ y . there are a lot of men better than him in this world .
that &apos;s not a bad thing .
there has never been a na@@ tion that was not even@@ tually de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
we &apos;ll be working on that this week .
I &apos;m not very busy .
where can I ex@@ change fore@@ ig@@ n cur@@ ren@@ cy ?
may I be of ser@@ v@@ ice ?
I wonder what I &apos;ll find in the bo@@ x .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
you are going too far .
drea@@ ms always come out differ@@ en@@ tly .
it wasn &apos;t always easy for E@@ di@@ son to inv@@ ent new things .
you look f@@ at .
my name &apos;s Tom .
what is the to@@ ta@@ l am@@ oun@@ t of money you sp@@ ent ?
if it s@@ no@@ ws tomorrow , I will buil@@ d a s@@ no@@ w@@ man .
this fr@@ u@@ it has an un@@ pleas@@ ant sm@@ ell .
un@@ less I leave right away , I &apos;ll be late for my appoin@@ t@@ ment .
this is what you &apos;ve been waiting for .
is this your book ?
I can &apos;t help but feel par@@ tly respon@@ sible .
there &apos;s nothing to re@@ port .
all of them are good , so cho@@ ose three books .
C@@ ig@@ ar@@ e@@ tt@@ e smo@@ ke bo@@ thers me a lot .
don &apos;t worry . I told you everything would be O@@ K .
he &apos;s no or@@ ig@@ in@@ al thin@@ k@@ er , but si@@ mp@@ ly im@@ it@@ ates what others have already said and done .
D@@ e@@ ce@@ mber has thir@@ ty @-@ one days .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
is it difficult to learn Ch@@ in@@ ese ?
I &apos;m a f@@ an of German op@@ er@@ a .
I met a friend while I was waiting for a bus .
that door won &apos;t open .
we &apos;re not foo@@ ls .
did you re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze any of those people ?
an interest@@ ing pro@@ pos@@ al . need to think it over .
he is a sor@@ t of poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an .
B@@ er@@ t &apos;s b@@ is@@ ex@@ u@@ al@@ ity was trou@@ b@@ ling Tom and exc@@ ited Mary .
many fore@@ ig@@ n@@ ers speak good Japanese .
Sami ac@@ ted alone .
how did you pu@@ ll it off ?
the cur@@ few is at 1@@ 0 P@@ M .
he is not at home .
how is your daughter ?
they were dis@@ appoin@@ ted that you could not come .
have you ever heard of this person .
you should be happy for me .
I hur@@ ried my clothes on .
can I make one ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation ?
you should put on some clothes .
don &apos;t give up .
I &apos;m going to do you a fav@@ or .
she pati@@ en@@ tly wa@@ ited for him .
let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself .
that was a good idea .
in Japan you can always cat@@ ch a ca@@ b , day or night .
why are you waiting here ?
there &apos;s a chance that ta@@ p water may con@@ tain har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stan@@ ces like ch@@ l@@ or@@ ine and lea@@ d .
he &apos;s a s@@ cre@@ en@@ writ@@ er .
dri@@ ve on .
bus@@ iness is bus@@ iness !
it must &apos;ve been ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely pain@@ ful .
looking at that gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c , one can tell ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely easily that we are fol@@ low@@ ing an ex@@ p@@ on@@ enti@@ al g@@ row@@ th .
I believe Tom will be ac@@ qu@@ itted .
promise me you won &apos;t to do anything stu@@ p@@ id .
he doesn &apos;t even know that I ex@@ ist .

a ser@@ ies of b@@ la@@ sts re@@ du@@ ced the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to ru@@ ins .
I wanted something to eat .
you &apos;re over@@ wor@@ ked .
when I reali@@ zed it was ra@@ ining , I took my u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la .
she went to the mus@@ e@@ um by ta@@ x@@ i .
but the c@@ ase ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less is , that those things der@@ i@@ ve their or@@ ig@@ in from the pro@@ x@@ y@@ s@@ m of the c@@ ru@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ ion , and the the@@ ory de@@ du@@ ced th@@ er@@ e@@ from , which was , that one person could st@@ and in the place of another , and could per@@ for@@ m mer@@ it@@ or@@ ious ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es for him .
the future is no longer what it used to be .
a father sh@@ ouldn &apos;t shir@@ k his respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties to his children .
how does it work ?
J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s two years ol@@ der than me .
he &apos;s in char@@ ge of the sal@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment .
a se@@ ven@@ th ch@@ or@@ d is com@@ posed of four no@@ tes .
Tom knew Mary wouldn &apos;t let him kis@@ s her .
we have different ways of thinking .
I like the kind of music that Tom pla@@ ys .
we have nothing to f@@ ear but f@@ ear it@@ self .
Mary will watch Tom .
I don &apos;t want to wake my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s .
how long were you there ?
the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic h@@ it an ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
that &apos;s why I need a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
the si@@ ght sent chil@@ ls of de@@ light up my sp@@ ine .
&quot; are sci@@ enti@@ sts close to cl@@ on@@ ing a hu@@ man being ? &quot; &quot; not by a long shot . &quot;
A@@ cc@@ es@@ sing fore@@ ig@@ n we@@ b@@ sit@@ es that didn &apos;t re@@ gi@@ ster with the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is il@@ le@@ g@@ al in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .

these are my students .
fi@@ x the clock on the w@@ all .
what is the tal@@ le@@ st m@@ oun@@ tain in E@@ uro@@ pe ?
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bit cold .
I can &apos;t dri@@ ve a bus .
I &apos;m not going to li@@ e to you .
I &apos;m going to buy a ca@@ mer@@ a for my daughter .
I want to be with Tom .
it &apos;s hard to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language .
I &apos;m not a dis@@ belie@@ ver .
I &apos;ve always won@@ dered what it &apos;d be like to have si@@ bl@@ ings .
you must o@@ be@@ y your parents .
I &apos;m really sorry about last night .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
come on , you can do better than this !
we had to make the best of a bad dea@@ l .
I want to wear a tur@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ e@@ ck in this weather .
who was the girl you were with the other day ?
A@@ l@@ low me to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself .

I should tell you something .
my father lea@@ ves for the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates next W@@ e@@ d@@ ne@@ s@@ day .

the f@@ un@@ ds are not su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent for run@@ ning a g@@ ro@@ cer@@ y .
I mis@@ sed the two o &apos;@@ clock plan@@ e .
I had to make a choice .
do you think this ro@@ pe is str@@ ong enough ?
the w@@ ound left a s@@ car on her ar@@ m .
did Tom tell you where to par@@ k ?
Tom is a C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an who lives in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a .
we couldn &apos;t help feeling sorry for her .
many people like to tra@@ vel .
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s important to me .
she &apos;s a bit of a s@@ no@@ b .
the accident came about through my car@@ ele@@ s@@ s@@ ness .
I &apos;m tired . it &apos;s been a long day .
I wasn &apos;t born here , but I sp@@ ent all of my early chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood here .
Tom would l@@ end you money if you asked him to .
she p@@ ou@@ red a c@@ up of te@@ a for me .
it &apos;s all the same to him .
that was stu@@ p@@ id .
I must make an ap@@ olo@@ gy to her .

I want to become a w@@ it@@ ch .

the G@@ re@@ at D@@ an@@ e is a b@@ re@@ ed of do@@ me@@ st@@ ic dog known for its gi@@ ant si@@ ze .
I &apos;d like to ask you about a student of yours .
don &apos;t run .
the re@@ sul@@ t won &apos;t really be good .
the trouble is that gl@@ asses always get lost .
I can i@@ mag@@ ine how you felt .
don &apos;t leave your dog in@@ side all day .
it &apos;s bus@@ iness as usu@@ al .
when we arrived , all the sto@@ res were clos@@ ed .
will we be in time for the concer@@ t ?
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come in ?
is this le@@ g@@ al ?
I felt th@@ re@@ at@@ ened .
I don &apos;t want that .
nobody knows what happened to him .
K@@ ab@@ y@@ li@@ e is a to@@ l@@ er@@ ant country un@@ like A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
Tom is a ge@@ o@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
they were clos@@ ed .
I want children .

Christ@@ i@@ ans believe that J@@ e@@ su@@ s is God .
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
if you only had one more week to live , what would you spend your time doing ?
I thought this buil@@ ding was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I &apos;m really pr@@ ou@@ d of this .
when did you visit your friends ?
why do I have to do this by myself ?
I had my bir@@ thday party at a restaurant .
Tom has very sh@@ ort hair .
